# OSC 8 hyperlinks — implementation plan

Source issue: [warpdotdev/warp#6393](https://github.com/warpdotdev/warp/issues/6393).
Behavior: see [`product.md`](product.md).

## Context

OSC 8 is the cross-terminal escape sequence for attaching a URL to a span of cells (`ESC ] 8 ; params ; URI ST` … visible text … `ESC ] 8 ; ; ST`). Warp parses OSC sequences via its alacritty/vte fork but currently has no `b"8"` arm — the bytes are dropped on the `_ => unhandled(params)` floor and the visible text becomes plain, unclickable output.

**ANSI processor** — `app/src/terminal/model/ansi/mod.rs:811-1230` is the OSC dispatch (`fn osc_dispatch`). It is a long match on the first param: `b"0" | b"2"`, `b"4"`, `b"9"`, `b"10" | b"11" | b"12"`, `b"50"`, `b"52"`, `b"104"`, `b"110-112"`, `b"133"` (prompt markers), `b"777"`, `b"1337"` (iTerm images), and several Warp-specific OSC numbers. Each arm calls into the `Handler` trait. The dispatcher itself stays stateless; per-stream state lives on the implementer.

**Handler trait** — `app/src/terminal/model/ansi/handler.rs:27-…`. Long trait with required and default methods. Default methods are used for hooks that not every implementor cares about (`prompt_marker`, `pluggable_notification`, the Warp DCS hook callbacks). Today's implementors: `GridHandler` (`app/src/terminal/model/grid/ansi_handler.rs:159`), `BlockGrid` (`app/src/terminal/model/blockgrid.rs:704`), `Block` (`app/src/terminal/model/block.rs:2906`), `AltScreen` (`app/src/terminal/model/alt_screen.rs:371`), `EarlyOutputHandler` (`app/src/terminal/model/early_output.rs:298`), and the test `MockHandler` (`app/src/terminal/model/ansi/mod_test.rs:24`).

**Shared ANSI types** — `crates/warp_terminal/src/model/ansi/control_sequence_parameters.rs`. `Attr`, `Mode`, `CursorStyle`, `PromptMarker` etc. live here and are re-exported by `app/src/terminal/model/ansi/mod.rs:21` (`pub use warp_terminal::model::ansi::control_sequence_parameters::*;`). New shared types (`Hyperlink`) belong here so both the parser and the trait can name them.

**Cell storage — block list path (`FlatStorage`).** `crates/warp_terminal/src/model/grid/flat_storage/` uses a run-length-encoded `AttributeMap<T>` per attribute: `FgColorMap` and `BgAndStyleMap` (`flat_storage/style.rs:18-21`). This representation deduplicates long runs of cells that share the same value into a single map entry — a perfect fit for hyperlinks, where one OSC 8 span typically covers many adjacent cells with the same URI. Used by `GridHandler` (`grid_handler.rs:381`).

**Cell storage — alt-screen / row-based path (`Cell` + `Row`).** `crates/warp_terminal/src/model/grid/cell.rs:144` defines `Cell` (24 bytes, deliberately tightly packed; the doc comment at line 122 calls out that adding bytes to `Cell` itself bumps the struct to 32 bytes — a 33% memory hit). Optional rare attributes go in `CellExtra` (`cell.rs:113-120`), a boxed side allocation that already holds `cell_with_zero_width` and `end_of_prompt`. Hyperlinks belong in `CellExtra`, not in the base `Cell`.

**Auto-detected URL flow — the model that the OSC 8 plumbing should mirror:**
- Detection lives in `app/src/terminal/model/grid/grid_handler.rs` via `pub fn url_at_point(&self, displayed_point: Point) -> Option<Link>` at line 596 and `Link` at line 143 (`{ range: RangeInclusive<Point>, is_empty: bool }`). `Link: ContainsPoint` (line 169).
- Higher-level wrappers: `app/src/terminal/model/blocks.rs:2460` (`url_at_point` returning `WithinBlock<Link>`), `app/src/terminal/model/alt_screen.rs:285`, and `app/src/terminal/model/terminal_model.rs:1815` (`link_at_range`) / `1844` (`url_at_point` returning `WithinModel<Link>`).
- View layer: `app/src/terminal/view/link_detection.rs` defines `GridHighlightedLink::{Url(WithinModel<Link>), File(WithinModel<FileLink>)}` (line 48), the hover state machine that calls `model.url_at_point(...)` → `self.highlighted_link.set(GridHighlightedLink::Url(url), ...)` at lines 299-310, and the click handler at lines 391-395 (`GridHighlightedLink::Url(url) => { let model = self.model.lock(); ctx.open_url(&model.link_at_range(url, ...)); }`). Right-click context menu and `OpenGridLink` action wiring is in `app/src/terminal/view.rs:24786`.
- Critically: the URL the auto-detector hands to `ctx.open_url` is recovered from the cell text via `link_at_range` — there is no notion of a URL stored separately from the cells. OSC 8 inverts that: the URI is independent of the visible text and must be carried alongside the cells.

A WIP foundation (`Hyperlink` type + parser + Handler hook + OSC 8 dispatch arm + parser unit tests) was scaffolded earlier on this branch and stashed; it is referenced where useful but is not the spec.

## Proposed changes

The implementation is broken into the layers below, listed bottom-up. Each layer can be merged independently behind the `OscHyperlinks` feature flag described in (6); the ordering in **Parallelization** below maps each layer to its dependencies. Layer 5a (scheme allow-list) is independent of the rest and intentionally lands first as a hardening of the existing URL click path.

### 1. ANSI types — `crates/warp_terminal/src/model/ansi/control_sequence_parameters.rs`

Add a `Hyperlink { id: Option<String>, uri: String }` value type, a `HyperlinkParseError`, and `Hyperlink::parse_osc_params(params: &[&[u8]]) -> Result<Option<Self>, HyperlinkParseError>`.

**Parser contract.** The OSC 8 grammar is `OSC 8 ; params ; URI ST`. The vte parser splits OSC bytes on `;` and hands `params: &[&[u8]]` to the dispatcher; this function takes the slice **after** the leading `b"8"` identifier:

1. **Field layout.** Treat the first slice element as the params field. Treat **all subsequent slice elements rejoined with `b";"`** as the URI field. This explicit rejoin is the parser's single most important rule: real-world URIs contain `;` (matrix params, query separators in some encodings, jsessionid, percent-encoded payloads), and the vte parser will split such URIs across multiple `params` entries. The contract — URI is always the rejoin of `params[1..]` — guarantees those URIs are reconstructed correctly by every implementation. Implementations that follow only the "two-field" mental shortcut **will silently drop valid URIs** and must not pass review.
2. **Close form.** `params == []`, or `params == [b""]`, or the rejoined URI field is empty → `Ok(None)`. Three accepted shapes because real emitters send all three.
3. **Open form.** Rejoined URI field is non-empty → parse the params field and return `Ok(Some(Hyperlink {...}))`. The params field is split on `:`; recognized keys are `id=...`, all others ignored. A params entry without `=` is `Err(MalformedParam)`.
4. **Error cases.** Non-UTF-8 bytes in the URI → `Err(InvalidUtf8)`. URI exceeding `MAX_URI_BYTES` (a `pub const` defined in this module — see §3) → `Err(InvalidUtf8)`, **checked on the raw `&[u8]` rejoin before allocating the URI `String`**, so a 1 GB OSC 8 sequence never produces a 1 GB allocation. Empty params slice with no opening byte at all isn't reachable because `osc_dispatch` already guards against `params.is_empty()`.

**Parser unit tests** live next to the type in a `#[cfg(test)] mod hyperlink_parse_tests`. The required ones:

- **`uri_with_semicolons_is_rejoined`** (anti-regression for finding 5 in the third Oz pass): input `params == [b"", b"https://example.com/a?x=1", b"y=2"]`; assert URI is `"https://example.com/a?x=1;y=2"`. **Failing this test is the cardinal indicator of an implementation that took the two-field shortcut.**
- `open_with_no_params`, `open_with_id_param`, `close_canonical`, `close_single_empty_field`, `close_zero_fields`.
- `unknown_keys_in_params_are_ignored`, `multiple_params_separated_by_colons`, `malformed_param_without_equals_rejected`.
- `non_utf8_uri_rejected`.

Tradeoffs considered:
- **Storing `id` and `uri` directly vs. interning.** Interning at parse time would couple the parser to an app-level registry. The parser stays pure and small; deduplication happens at the storage layer (3).
- **`Hyperlink` as an enum vs. struct.** A `Hyperlink::Open(_)`/`Hyperlink::Close` enum is more self-describing than `Option<Hyperlink>`, but the close form has no payload, so `Option` is the smaller surface and matches `set_title(Option<String>)` and similar Handler signatures.

### 2. Handler trait + OSC 8 dispatch — `app/src/terminal/model/ansi/handler.rs` and `mod.rs`

Add a default-impl method on `Handler`:

```rust
fn set_hyperlink(&mut self, _hyperlink: Option<Hyperlink>) {}
```

The default-impl pattern matches `prompt_marker`, `pluggable_notification`, and the Warp DCS hook callbacks; existing implementors continue to compile unchanged and only the implementors that need to actually attach hyperlinks to cells (3) override it.

In `osc_dispatch`, add a `b"8"` arm next to `b"9"`/`b"133"`:

```rust
b"8" => match Hyperlink::parse_osc_params(&params[1..]) {
    Ok(hyperlink) => self.handler.set_hyperlink(hyperlink),
    Err(_) => unhandled(params),
},
```

### 3. Cell storage — attaching the hyperlink to cells

The implementation needs a deduplicated registry keyed by an opaque small-integer `HyperlinkId` so cells store a 4-byte handle rather than a per-cell `Arc<Hyperlink>`. The registry is per-grid (block-scoped on `BlockList`, screen-scoped on `AltScreen`).

```rust
// New module: crates/warp_terminal/src/model/grid/hyperlink_registry.rs
pub struct HyperlinkId(NonZeroU32);
pub struct HyperlinkRegistry { /* HashMap<Hyperlink, HyperlinkId> + Vec<Hyperlink> */ }
impl HyperlinkRegistry {
    /// Returns `Some(id)` for a successful intern, `None` if the
    /// distinct-entries cap is hit. The URI byte length cap is
    /// enforced earlier — in `parse_osc_params` (§1) — so a too-long
    /// URI never reaches `intern`. That keeps the failure-modes per
    /// caller simple: parse-time gives `Err(InvalidUtf8)`, intern-time
    /// gives `None`.
    pub fn intern(&mut self, h: Hyperlink) -> Option<HyperlinkId>;
    pub fn get(&self, id: HyperlinkId) -> Option<&Hyperlink>;
}
```

Two storage variants need wiring:

**3a. `FlatStorage` (block list).** Add a third `AttributeMap<Option<HyperlinkId>>` parallel to `FgColorMap`/`BgAndStyleMap` in `crates/warp_terminal/src/model/grid/flat_storage/mod.rs`. RLE compression makes a 100-cell hyperlink cost one map entry. A new `flat_storage/hyperlink.rs` module mirroring `flat_storage/style.rs` is the natural shape.

**3b. `Cell` / `Row` (alt-screen and other row-based grids).** Extend `CellExtra` (`crates/warp_terminal/src/model/grid/cell.rs:113`) with `hyperlink_id: Option<HyperlinkId>` and add accessors `Cell::hyperlink_id() / Cell::set_hyperlink_id()`. The 24→24 byte budget for `Cell` itself is preserved because the new field lives in the boxed extra. Resetting a cell preserves `EndOfPromptMarker`; preserve `hyperlink_id` only while the cell still has content.

**3c. Single owner for active id and registry (delegation path).** Active hyperlink state and the registry both live in **one place**, the same place that `input(c: char)` stamps cells with attributes. That's `GridHandler` for `BlockList` flow and `AltScreen`'s own grid for the alt-screen flow. `BlockGrid` and `Block` do **not** carry independent copies; they delegate `set_hyperlink` (and cell stamping) to the inner `GridHandler`. Concretely:

| Type | Owns `active_hyperlink_id`? | Owns `HyperlinkRegistry`? | `set_hyperlink` impl |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GridHandler` (`grid/ansi_handler.rs:159`) | yes | yes | updates own state, interns into own registry |
| `BlockGrid` (`blockgrid.rs:704`) | no | no | forwards to `self.grid_handler.set_hyperlink(...)` (matches existing delegation pattern for `terminal_attribute`, `input`, etc.) |
| `Block` (`block.rs:2906`) | no | no | forwards via `BlockGrid` to the inner `GridHandler` |
| `AltScreen` (`alt_screen.rs:371`) | yes | yes | parallel to `GridHandler`, owns its own state because alt-screen doesn't share a grid with the block list |
| `EarlyOutputHandler` (`early_output.rs:298`) | no | no | inherits the default `Handler::set_hyperlink` no-op; OSC 8 in early-output is safely dropped |

This makes `set_hyperlink` and the cell-stamping path read the same field. The risk the reviewer flagged — `set_hyperlink` updating one copy while `input` reads another — is closed by ownership, not by careful synchronization.

```rust
// In GridHandler (and AltScreen with the same shape):
fn set_hyperlink(&mut self, hyperlink: Option<Hyperlink>) {
    self.active_hyperlink_id = hyperlink.and_then(|h| self.hyperlink_registry.intern(h));
}

// In BlockGrid and Block:
fn set_hyperlink(&mut self, hyperlink: Option<Hyperlink>) {
    self.grid_handler.set_hyperlink(hyperlink);
}
```

The `and_then` (vs `map`) is the second half of finding 3: when `intern` returns `None` because the registry is full, `active_hyperlink_id` stays `None` and the visible text from the OSC 8 sequence renders as plain non-clickable cells — there is no path where a cell's `hyperlink_id` references an entry that doesn't exist.

The grid's `input(&mut self, c: char)` path stamps `self.active_hyperlink_id` into each newly-written cell, in the same place SGR styling is applied today.

**3d. Behavior under cell-mutating operations.** OSC 8 makes `hyperlink_id` a per-cell attribute, so every operation that changes cell content has to make an explicit choice about it. The rule, applied uniformly:

| Operation | What happens to existing `hyperlink_id` on touched cells | Implementation note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `input(c)` (write a char to cursor) | replaced with `self.active_hyperlink_id` (which may be `None`) | same place SGR is applied; never inherits the previous cell's id |
| `erase_chars(n)` | cleared to `None` along with all other cell attrs | erased cells render as default-state blanks; **must not** stay clickable |
| `clear_line(LineClearMode::*)` | cleared to `None` for the affected range | same |
| `clear_screen(ClearMode::*)` | cleared to `None` for the affected range | same |
| `delete_chars(n)` | cells are *removed* and following cells shift left; surviving cells keep their ids | id moves with the cell; the trailing inserted blanks have `None` |
| `insert_blank(n)` | newly inserted blanks have `None`; following cells shift right with their ids intact | the active id is **not** stamped onto the inserted blanks — `input` is the only writer that does that |
| `delete_lines(n)` / `insert_blank_lines(n)` | analogous: surviving rows keep ids; new blank rows have all `None` | |
| `scroll_up` / `scroll_down` | scrolled-out rows are dropped (their ids stop being referenced); newly exposed rows have all `None` | the registry itself does not shrink — see no-reclaim §3 |
| `reverse_index` (RI) | like `scroll_down` for boundary cases; otherwise cell content is preserved with its id | |
| `decaln` (DECALN — fill screen with `E`) | ids cleared along with content reset | |
| `reset_state` | `active_hyperlink_id = None`; **all cell ids cleared as a side effect of cell reset**; registry left intact (no-reclaim is fine here) | parallels how `terminal_attribute(Attr::Reset)` behaves, except scoped to the whole grid |
| Block boundary (`prompt_marker` start) | `active_hyperlink_id = None`; the previous block's cell ids are unchanged (block is now scrollback) | see invariant 10 |

Without this section, an implementer could plausibly leave erased blanks with stale ids (clickable empty space) or stamp the active id onto inserted blanks (a "Click to view scan report" link suddenly extending into the blank insert region). The table is the contract that prevents both.

**Bounded registry, no reclamation (security: DoS resistance).** Terminal output is untrusted and a hostile or buggy process can emit unlimited unique URIs. Two caps, enforced at different layers, and **a no-reclaim model**: entries are never freed while the registry is alive. The registry's lifetime is the grid's lifetime — when the grid (block, alt-screen, etc.) is dropped or replaced, the entire registry goes with it.

| Cap | Default | Enforced where | Behavior on hit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Max URI byte length | 4096 | `parse_osc_params` (§1) — checked before allocating the `String`, so a 1 GB OSC 8 sequence never produces a 1 GB allocation | parser returns `Err(InvalidUtf8)`; dispatcher passes the OSC to `unhandled(params)`; `set_hyperlink` is **not** called. The visible text continues to render (invariant 15). |
| Max distinct entries per registry | 4096 | `HyperlinkRegistry::intern` | returns `None`; `set_hyperlink` lands `active_hyperlink_id = None`; the still-active OSC 8 span renders as plain non-clickable cells. Existing entries stay valid; old links remain clickable. A `log::warn!` fires once per cap hit per registry. |
| Max referencing cells per entry | unbounded | n/a | bounded indirectly by the grid's row cap. |

**Why no reclamation.** A reclamation model would need consistent reference-count accounting across cell overwrites (replace `hyperlink_id`, dec/inc), row eviction from scrollback, RLE run splits and merges in `FlatStorage`, reflow on resize (rows rebuilt from underlying spans), and deserialization (incoming cells must bump counts on the loaded registry). Getting any one of those wrong leaks entries (memory creep) or under-counts (use-after-free of an `id` that still appears in some cell). For a feature where the steady-state working set per block is small (single-digit URLs in real-world output) and the cap (4096 entries × ~1 KB average ≈ 4 MB) is already small, the simpler "registry grows monotonically until grid is dropped" model is the right tradeoff — and trivially correct under all of the above transitions because the only mutation is "append at intern time."

**Block-grid lifetime.** Per product invariant 10, a `BlockList` block is the natural unit of registry ownership: hyperlinks are reset on prompt-marker boundaries, and when a block is fully evicted from scrollback the whole block (including its registry) is dropped. So the working set is bounded by the *current* block's distinct URLs, not the session's. `AltScreen` registries are cleared on screen reset.

**Caps are `pub const`** in the registry module so tests can override them via `#[cfg(test)] const MAX_DISTINCT_ENTRIES: usize = 4;` in a test-only build.

Tests (in `hyperlink_registry_tests.rs` and `parse_osc_params` parser tests):
- **Parser** (`parse_osc_params`): a URI exceeding `MAX_URI_BYTES` returns `Err(InvalidUtf8)`. **The parser does not allocate the URI `String` before checking length** — verified by a test that supplies `&[u8]` of length `MAX_URI_BYTES + 1` and asserts the function returns `Err` synchronously without holding a `String` of that size on the heap.
- **Registry intern**: `intern` returns `Some(id)` up to `MAX_DISTINCT_ENTRIES` distinct interns; the first call past the cap returns `None`, all earlier ids stay valid. The cap-hit `log::warn!` fires exactly once.
- **`set_hyperlink` glue**: when `intern` returns `None`, `active_hyperlink_id` is `None` and subsequent `input(c)` writes plain non-clickable cells.
- **No-reclaim under churn**: overwrite all cells in a row that referenced a hyperlink; assert `registry.len_for_test()` does not decrease. Documented as the intended behavior, not a bug.
- **1 MB OSC 8 doesn't OOM**: feed a 1 MB OSC 8 sequence; assert no allocation of comparable size occurs (memory-tracked test allocator) and the visible text falls through to the next valid sequence.
- **Drop = free**: dropping a `BlockList` block drops its registry (asserted via a `Weak`/Drop counter in tests).
- **3d behavior table**: one test per row of the §3d table — write text under an active link, apply the operation, assert `hyperlink_id` matches the table.

### 4. Lookup helpers — model layer

Mirror the auto-detected URL flow.

The existing `Link` (`grid_handler.rs:143`) is a single `RangeInclusive<Point>` and represents one contiguous run. Per product invariant 5 (narrowed in this revision), an OSC 8 span is also a single contiguous run — the cells written between one `set_hyperlink(Some(_))` call and its matching `set_hyperlink(None)`/implicit close. We therefore reuse `Link` as-is for the v1 lookup. Cross-run grouping by `id` (a non-contiguous "link group" of the same `id`) is **not** supported in v1 because `Link` cannot represent multiple disjoint ranges; see Follow-ups for the multi-range path.

- `GridHandler::hyperlink_at_point(&self, point: Point) -> Option<Link>` (`grid_handler.rs`, alongside the existing `url_at_point` at line 596). Returns the contiguous `Link` for the OSC 8 span at `point`, expanded by walking left/right while the cell's `HyperlinkId` matches and the cells remain adjacent.
- `GridHandler::hyperlink_uri_at_point(&self, point: Point) -> Option<&str>` to read the URI without recovering it from cell text.
- Block / alt-screen / model-level wrappers paralleling `blocks.rs:2460`, `alt_screen.rs:285`, `terminal_model.rs:1844` (`hyperlink_at_point`, `hyperlink_uri_at_range`).

### 5. View layer — hover, click, copy, context menu

`app/src/terminal/view/link_detection.rs`:

- Extend `GridHighlightedLink` with a third variant: `Hyperlink(WithinModel<Link>, String /* uri */)`. The variant carries the URI directly because, unlike `Url`, it is not recoverable from the cell text.
- In the hover state machine (lines 299-339), call `model.hyperlink_at_point(position)` first; if it returns `Some`, set `GridHighlightedLink::Hyperlink(...)`. Only fall through to `url_at_point` (and the file-path scanner) when no OSC 8 span is found at that point — this implements product invariant 9 (OSC 8 wins over auto-detected URL on the same cell).
- In the click handler (lines 391-395), add the `Hyperlink` arm: pass the URI through the centralized scheme validator (5a) before any open call; if it fails, the click is a no-op and the hover tooltip surfaces the rejection reason. Same telemetry path (`TelemetryEvent::OpenLink`).
- Tooltip text: `GridHighlightedLink::tooltip_text` (line 63) returns "Open link" for the new variant; for a hyperlink whose scheme fails the allow-list, the tooltip text is "Scheme not allowed: <scheme>" so the user understands why the click is inert.

`app/src/terminal/view.rs`:

- The `OpenGridLink(link)` action (line 24786) gets a new arm for `Hyperlink` that calls the validated open helper from (5a).
- The right-click context menu wiring around line 15040 gets a `GridHighlightedLink::Hyperlink` branch with "Open link" / "Copy link" items. "Open link" routes through (5a). "Copy link" copies the URI to the clipboard verbatim regardless of scheme — copying is not navigating, so the allow-list does not gate it.

### 5a. Centralized scheme allow-list (security)

Terminal output is untrusted, OSC 8 carries arbitrary URIs, and `ctx.open_url` is a thin wrapper that hands the string to the platform — it is **not** itself a validator. We add a single chokepoint that every open path must call. The validator takes the URI as a `&str` (not a parsed `Url`) so it never forces the caller to throw away a URI that happens to be unparseable — that matters for hover/copy on malformed input (product invariant 15) — and is parameterized by `LinkSource` so OSC 8 can be conservative without regressing the existing auto-detected URL behavior (product invariant 18).

```rust
// New module: app/src/terminal/view/link_security.rs

/// What pipeline produced the URI we're about to open. Determines
/// which allow-list applies. See product invariant 16.
#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, Eq, PartialEq)]
pub enum LinkSource {
    /// URI was emitted by the program via OSC 8. URI is decoupled
    /// from visible text and entirely attacker-controlled.
    OscHyperlink,
    /// URI was extracted from the visible cell text by the existing
    /// urlocator-based scanner. The user could already see and copy
    /// it by hand.
    AutoDetected,
}

pub enum SchemeCheck {
    Allowed,
    Rejected { reason: SchemeRejectReason },
}

pub enum SchemeRejectReason {
    Unparseable,
    DisallowedScheme { scheme: String },
}

/// Returns Allowed iff the URI parses as a URL whose scheme is in the
/// allow-list for `source`. Called by every code path that opens a
/// URI coming from terminal output.
pub fn check_open_scheme(uri: &str, source: LinkSource) -> SchemeCheck;

/// Convenience: validate then call ctx.open_url. Returns SchemeCheck
/// so the caller can pick a tooltip and decide whether to fire
/// OpenLink telemetry.
pub fn open_validated(
    ctx: &mut impl AppContextLike,
    uri: &str,
    source: LinkSource,
) -> SchemeCheck;
```

**Allow-lists, both compile-time `const &[&str]`** so the boundary is auditable. Product invariant 16 is the source of truth.

```rust
const OSC8_ALLOWED_SCHEMES: &[&str] = &["http", "https", "mailto", "ftp"];

// Mirrors what `urlocator` (the existing auto-detect scanner) emits today.
// We codify it as a `const` rather than asking the validator to ask
// urlocator at runtime — `LinkSource::AutoDetected` URIs always pass through
// urlocator first, so any scheme that reaches `check_open_scheme` from this
// source is already in this set. Locking it down as a `const` lets us
// detect drift if urlocator (or our use of it) ever expands what it emits.
const AUTO_DETECTED_ALLOWED_SCHEMES: &[&str] =
    &["http", "https", "ftp", "ftps", "file", "git", "ssh", "mailto", "news", "gopher"];
```

**Why two lists, not one.**
- *OSC 8* is attacker-chosen output that the user has not yet seen written out as a URL — it could be hidden behind any visible text. Conservative by default.
- *Auto-detected* extracts URIs that already exist as visible text in the block; the user could highlight and copy them by hand. Tightening that path beyond what `urlocator` already produces would be a regression on invariant 18 (notably, `file:` and `ssh:` links from `git status` / `ls -F` output). That regression risk is not introduced by this PR and shouldn't be silently fixed by it; the discussion of whether to drop `file:` from auto-detect is a separate spec.

**Migration / rollout.**
- The auto-detected URL flow gains validation in this PR. Because `AUTO_DETECTED_ALLOWED_SCHEMES` mirrors what urlocator emits today, validation is a no-op on the happy path; what it *does* prevent is bypass attacks where a URI sourced from another path (e.g. a custom rich-content link) is fed into the auto-detected open path with an unexpected scheme.
- Telemetry: emit `LinkRejectedScheme { source, scheme }` on every `Rejected` outcome. We expect ≈0 `AutoDetected` rejections post-rollout. Any non-zero count flags drift between `AUTO_DETECTED_ALLOWED_SCHEMES` and what urlocator now emits — both lists must change in lockstep.
- If urlocator ever expands its detected schemes (or we adopt a different scanner), `AUTO_DETECTED_ALLOWED_SCHEMES` is the one place that must change to preserve invariant 18.
- No data migration is needed because both lists are compile-time only.

**Hover, copy, and click semantics for malformed/disallowed URIs** (product invariant 15):
- The hyperlink span on the cells is unaffected by validity: hover always works, the tooltip always shows the literal URI, and right-click "Copy link" always copies the literal URI to the clipboard regardless of `SchemeCheck`. Validation only gates *opening* the URI.
- Click ("Open link") paths call `open_validated` and switch on the result:
  - `Allowed` → URI was opened; tooltip is "Open link".
  - `Rejected { Unparseable }` → click was a no-op; tooltip is "Cannot open: URI is malformed".
  - `Rejected { DisallowedScheme { scheme } }` → click was a no-op; tooltip is "Scheme not allowed: <scheme>".

Required call sites (each one becomes a "must call `open_validated` / `check_open_scheme`" bullet in code review):

- `app/src/terminal/view/link_detection.rs:391` — auto-detected URL click. **Today this calls `ctx.open_url` directly with no validation; this PR closes that gap as well**, so OSC 8 and auto-detected URLs share the same security boundary.
- New `Hyperlink` arm in the click handler.
- The `OpenGridLink` action arm at `app/src/terminal/view.rs:24786`.
- The right-click "Open link" menu arm.
- Any future code path that opens a URL that originated in terminal output. Lint rule (custom clippy or grep-based presubmit check) flags raw `ctx.open_url` calls inside `app/src/terminal/view/`; existing call sites that open *Warp-internal* URLs (settings deep links, docs URLs) are explicitly allow-listed in the lint.

Tests live in `link_security_tests.rs`:
- `http://x`, `https://x`, `mailto:a@b`, `ftp://x` → `Allowed`.
- `javascript:alert(1)`, `data:text/html,…`, `file:///etc/passwd`, `vbscript:`, `about:blank`, empty scheme → `Rejected { DisallowedScheme }`.
- Mixed-case (`HTTP://`, `JavaScript:`) is canonicalized — case-insensitive scheme match.
- Garbage strings (`"hello world"`, `""`, `"://"`) → `Rejected { Unparseable }`.
- A click test for OSC 8 with `javascript:alert(1)` confirms `ctx.open_url` is **never** called and the tooltip shows the rejection reason.
- A hover test for an unparseable URI confirms the tooltip still shows the literal URI and "Copy link" still copies it.

### 6. Feature flag

`FeatureFlag::OscHyperlinks` (added per `WARP.md`'s feature-flag guide, defaulted on for dogfood) gates **OSC 8 specific** behavior only: when off, `osc_dispatch`'s `b"8"` arm calls `unhandled(params)` and the rest of layers (3)–(5)/(6a)/(7) never sees an OSC 8 hyperlink.

Layer (5a) — the scheme allow-list — is **deliberately not** gated by this flag. Validation is a hardening change to the existing auto-detected URL click path that benefits users regardless of OSC 8. Disabling `OscHyperlinks` must not regress security on the URL flow. The flag's compile-time wiring is restricted to the `b"8"` arm and the layer (5) `Hyperlink` variant of `GridHighlightedLink`; layer (5a) lives outside the flag and is on for everyone the moment its layer ships.

This split lets each layer land independently and lets the team revert OSC 8 in one place if a regression appears, without losing the hardening of the auto-detected URL flow.

### 6a. Session persistence (Warp Drive, history, shared sessions)

The three persistence formats have different shapes. Rather than one strategy, here's a per-format compatibility table — both directions (old client reading new payload, and new client reading old payload) — with a concrete migration plan for each.

**Common type changes (apply to all formats).**
- `HyperlinkId` is `#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]` over a `NonZeroU32`.
- `CellExtra` gains `#[serde(default, skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")] hyperlink_id: Option<HyperlinkId>`. `serde(default)` → new client reading old payload deserializes cleanly. `skip_serializing_if` → new client writing for cells that don't carry an id produces bytes byte-identical to today's, so old-client reads are unaffected for all non-hyperlinked output.

#### 6a-i. sqlite history (`crates/persistence`)

Block output is already stored as `stylized_output: String` (a Diesel `Binary`-backed `Text` column at `crates/persistence/src/schema.rs:79-99`) containing the **raw ANSI byte stream from the PTY**. OSC 8 bytes — those the original program emitted, including the URI — are already present in this string today; they're just dropped on the parser floor on every load. Once layer (2) ships, the same string passes through a parser that recognizes OSC 8 and the cells become clickable on every load.

- **No schema migration needed.** The Diesel migrations directory does not gain a new entry for this feature.
- **Old client → new payload (forward compat):** trivially fine — old clients have always written ANSI byte streams that may include OSC 8 sequences from the program.
- **New client → old payload (backward compat):** also fine — new clients read the same ANSI string, OSC 8 sequences re-parse, hyperlinks are restored. Blocks written before the feature shipped come back clickable too, for free.
- The `HyperlinkRegistry` itself is **not** persisted in sqlite — it's reconstructed from the byte stream on load. Saves us a column and a migration, and matches how every other terminal-state attribute (color, bold, etc.) is handled today.

#### 6a-ii. Warp Drive (cloud objects, shared sessions)

Warp Drive blocks store the same `SerializedBlock` shape (`app/src/terminal/model/block.rs:474-480`), with `stylized_output: String`. Same reasoning as sqlite: OSC 8 bytes round-trip transparently in the string and re-parse on load.

- **Forward and backward compat both ride for free** for the byte-stream encoding. No protocol-version bump is needed for blocks whose hyperlink state can be recovered from `stylized_output`.
- **Risk: a future representation change.** If Warp Drive ever moves from the byte-stream encoding to a structured per-cell encoding (e.g. for performance), the cell-side `hyperlink_id` field becomes the wire field of record. The `serde(default, skip_serializing_if)` defaults above already cover both directions. We name this in the spec so anyone making that representation change tests both compatibility directions.

#### 6a-iii. Session-sharing protocol (`session-sharing-protocol` workspace crate)

The session-sharing protocol streams **events**, not byte streams (set cursor, write char, set SGR, etc.). Adding OSC 8 means a new event:

```rust
// session-sharing-protocol — new event variant
SetHyperlink { hyperlink: Option<Hyperlink> },
```

The protocol's serialization (whichever framing — protobuf, MessagePack, JSON-over-WS) must handle unknown variants on the consuming side. Concrete plan:

- **Old client reading new payload:** the `SetHyperlink` event is unknown. Whatever framing the protocol uses, the receiver must skip-and-continue rather than error. We audit and (if needed) fix this path as part of the layer's PR.
  - For protobuf: unknown fields are skipped by default — no fix needed.
  - For serde-tagged JSON / MessagePack: add `#[serde(other)]` or a `Unknown` variant with `#[serde(skip_serializing)]` on a new event-envelope enum so deserializers tolerate forward-compatible additions.
- **New client reading old payload:** old payload simply doesn't contain `SetHyperlink` events. Cells render plain — graceful degradation, exactly what we want. No code path needed.
- **Active-state replay.** The session-sharing replay must apply `SetHyperlink` events in stream order; a late-joiner gets a `state_snapshot` followed by the live tail, and the snapshot needs to include the active hyperlink id. We add `active_hyperlink: Option<Hyperlink>` to the snapshot frame (same `#[serde(default)]` posture).
- **Versioning fallback.** If the protocol turns out to error on unknown events instead of skipping, we bump the protocol version and gate `SetHyperlink` behind a "OSC 8 supported" client capability negotiated at session start. Older clients negotiate down; newer clients fall back to not emitting the event when paired with an older peer.

#### Tests

- **sqlite round-trip** (`app/src/persistence/block_list.rs` test module): persist a block with `stylized_output` containing an OSC 8 sequence; reload from sqlite; assert the reloaded `Block` has cells with non-None `hyperlink_id` and the URI matches.
- **Warp Drive round-trip:** simulate the cloud serialization round-trip and verify the same.
- **Old-client read-of-new-payload (session-sharing):** a CI matrix test that pins the old client to a tag-before-this-PR, runs the new client as the producer, and asserts the old client renders cells correctly (just not clickable). Lives in `crates/integration` and runs as part of the protocol-compat CI job.
- **New-client read-of-old-payload (session-sharing):** the inverse — new client consumes a recorded session from before the PR; asserts the deserializer doesn't error and cells render plain.

This subsumes the earlier "session persistence" follow-up; it is no longer deferred.

### 7. Sharing, copy-as-markdown, and AI context

- **Markdown sharing** (product invariant 13, first sentence). The block→markdown serializer (search for `to_markdown` / shared-session export) emits `[visible text](URI)` for spans that carry a `HyperlinkId`.
- **Copy block as terminal bytes** (product invariant 13, second sentence). The byte serializer emits a *semantically equivalent* OSC 8 sequence around each span: `ESC ] 8 ; ; <uri> ESC \` … visible bytes … `ESC ] 8 ; ; ESC \`. We **do not** preserve the original OSC bytes — only the URI is round-tripped, params are normalized to empty, and the terminator is normalized to `ESC \`. This is deliberate: the registry stores normalized `Hyperlink { id, uri }`, not raw bytes, so byte-exact round-tripping would require carrying the original OSC bytes per cell. The cost (per-cell byte arrays) outweighs the benefit (only programs that round-trip Warp output through another OSC-8-aware terminal would notice the difference, and the receiving terminal renders the same clickable link either way). Product invariant 13 is updated to reflect this.
- **AI context** (invariant 14). The block→agent context formatter inlines `visible text (URI)` for hyperlinked spans so an agent reading wizcli output sees the URI without losing the visible label.

## Testing and validation

Each numbered item below maps to a product invariant from `product.md`.

**Unit tests — parser** (`crates/warp_terminal/src/model/ansi/control_sequence_parameters.rs`, `#[cfg(test)] mod hyperlink_parse_tests`).
- Open / open-with-id / close / single-empty-field-close / unknown-keys-ignored / malformed-param / multi-`:` param separators / **`uri_with_semicolons_is_rejoined`** (mandatory; see §1) / non-UTF-8 URI → invariants 1, 2, 3, 15.

**Unit tests — dispatch** (`app/src/terminal/model/ansi/mod_test.rs`, alongside the existing `parse_osc9_*` tests).
- Open + close fires two `set_hyperlink` events on `MockHandler` (the mock gets a `hyperlink_events: Vec<Option<Hyperlink>>` field) → invariant 1.
- Bell-terminated and ESC-`\`-terminated forms both work → invariant 1.
- Malformed `OSC 8 ; foo` (no URI segment) does not panic, does not fire an event → invariant 15.
- Empty-URI close after open clears → invariant 2.

**Unit tests — registry + cell stamping** (new `hyperlink_registry_tests.rs`, plus extension of `cell_test.rs`).
- `intern` deduplicates: same `Hyperlink{id:"foo", uri:"x"}` returns the same `HyperlinkId`. (Used internally so adjacent runs with the same `(id, uri)` share a slot — *not* a behavior the lookup layer exposes; see Follow-ups for cross-run grouping.)
- Different URIs (regardless of `id`) produce different `HyperlinkId`s — `(id, uri)` is the registry key.
- `Cell::set_hyperlink_id`/`hyperlink_id` round-trip; `CellExtra` allocation only occurs when first set; cell reset clears the slot.

**Unit tests — `FlatStorage`** (`flat_storage/mod_tests.rs`).
- Writing 100 cells under one active id RLE-collapses to one `AttributeMap` entry.
- Removing a row that ended a span doesn't bleed the active id into later writes.

**Unit tests — model lookups.** `hyperlink_at_point` returns the contiguous run of cells around `point` that share the same `HyperlinkId`, expanding left and right while the next cell is adjacent and carries the same id → invariants 5, 10. The lookup explicitly does **not** jump across non-adjacent cells even when `HyperlinkId` matches; cross-run grouping is out of scope.

**Integration tests** (`crates/integration/`, following the patterns in the `warp-integration-test` skill).
- **`osc8_open_close.rs`** — pipe an OSC 8 open + visible text + close to a fake PTY, assert the cells carry a hyperlink, hover one, observe `PointingHand` cursor and tooltip showing the URI → invariants 1, 5, 17.
- **`osc8_cmd_click_opens_url.rs`** — same setup, simulate Cmd+click on a hyperlinked cell, assert `ctx.open_url` was called with the URI (via the validated path) and that telemetry fired; simulate plain click and assert it was *not* called → invariants 6, 7.
- **`osc8_implicit_close_at_block_boundary.rs`** — open a hyperlink before a `precmd` / new prompt, assert the next block's cells do not carry the hyperlink → invariant 10.
- **`osc8_soft_wrap_keeps_one_span.rs`** — open a hyperlink whose visible text crosses a soft wrap; assert hover on either wrapped row highlights the full contiguous span and a single Cmd+click anywhere on the span opens the URI → invariants 5, 10. (Replaces the dropped non-contiguous `id` grouping test, which is moved to Follow-ups.)
- **`osc8_copy_text_vs_link.rs`** — select across a hyperlink and copy: clipboard contains visible text. Right-click → "Copy link": clipboard contains the URI → invariant 8.
- **`osc8_share_as_markdown.rs`** — share/copy-as-markdown produces `[visible](uri)` → invariant 13.
- **`osc8_disallowed_scheme_inert.rs`** — an OSC 8 span with `javascript:` URI does not navigate on click; tooltip shows "Scheme not allowed: javascript". Right-click → "Copy link" still copies the literal URI → invariants 15, 16.
- **`osc8_unparseable_uri_inert.rs`** — an OSC 8 span with a URI that fails URL parsing (e.g. `not a url`) is hoverable, copyable, and inert on click; tooltip shows "Cannot open: URI is malformed" → invariant 15.
- **`osc8_no_regression_on_url_autodetect.rs`** — output without OSC 8 still hyperlinks via auto-detection, and the auto-detected click also goes through `open_validated` (regression test for layer 5a) → invariant 18.

**Manual verification (recorded in PR description with a short clip).**
- Run `printf '\e]8;;https://warp.dev\e\\Open Warp\e]8;;\e\\\n'` in a Warp block; hover, observe pointer; Cmd+click, observe browser open.
- Run `wizcli` (or any CLI that emits OSC 8 — `gcc`, `make`, modern `git`) and exercise the live link.
- Run `cat` on a file containing a hyperlink across a wrapped line to confirm reflow on resize keeps the click intact.
- Run a TUI in alt-screen mode that emits OSC 8 (e.g. `lazygit`) to confirm parity with block-list behavior.

## Risks and mitigations

- **Memory / DoS from the registry.** Designed in, not deferred — see "Bounded registry, no reclamation" in (3). The cap (4096 distinct entries × 4096-byte max URI ≈ 16 MB worst-case per block) plus the bounded URI byte length plus the registry's grid-scoped lifetime put a hard ceiling on the working set. Adopting no-reclaim avoids a class of refcount/use-after-free bugs across cell overwrite, RLE split/merge, scrollback eviction, reflow, and deserialization.
- **Cell-size budget.** `cell.rs:122` is explicit that growing `Cell` past 24 bytes is a 33% memory hit. The `HyperlinkId` lives in `CellExtra` exactly to avoid this; the only `Cell`-shaped change is to `CellExtra`'s box, which is already optional and pays only when present.
- **Security: `javascript:` / `data:` / unexpected schemes.** Centralized in (5a) — every code path that can be reached from terminal output goes through `check_open_scheme` / `open_validated` before any platform open call. The plan also closes the same gap for the existing auto-detected URL flow.
- **URIs containing `;` are addressed in the parser contract,** not as a deferred mitigation. See §1: the URI field is the `b";"`-rejoin of all `params[1..]` slice elements, and a `uri_with_semicolons_is_rejoined` unit test is required.
- **Existing handler implementors not overriding `set_hyperlink`.** Default no-op means OSC 8 is silently dropped on those surfaces (e.g. `EarlyOutputHandler`). Acceptable: those surfaces don't render clickable output today either. They can be wired later without a behavior change for users.
- **Persistence compatibility, three formats, three different stories.** sqlite history and Warp Drive round-trip OSC 8 transparently because the format is already the raw ANSI byte stream — no schema or protocol change. Session-sharing is event-streamed and gains a new `SetHyperlink` event; old clients must skip unknown events (audited per-framing in §6a-iii) and a CI matrix locks in both directions of the compat. If skip-unknown turns out to be unavailable, the fallback is a client-capability negotiation that downgrades when paired with a pre-PR client.

## Parallelization

- Layer (1) — parser + types — is a single warp_terminal-crate change with no app dependencies.
- Layer (2) — Handler hook + dispatch — depends on (1) only.
- Layer (3a) and (3b) can run in parallel after (1). (3c) depends on (2) and the chosen (3a/3b) for the surface it covers.
- Layer (4) depends on (3).
- Layer (5) depends on (4).
- Layer (5a) — scheme allow-list — depends on nothing else and can land first as a hardening change to the existing auto-detected URL click path. Doing it first means (5)'s `Hyperlink` arm has the validator already in place.
- Layer (6a) — session persistence — depends on (3) (the on-cell field shape) and on the session-sharing protocol crate. Independent of (4)/(5).
- Layer (7) (sharing, AI context) depends on (3) but is otherwise independent of (4)/(5)/(6a).

The natural agent split is: one agent on (5a) (lands independently, no dependency on the rest); one on (1)+(2)+parser tests; one on (3a); one on (3b); then one each on (4), (5), (6a), (7).

## Follow-ups

- **Cross-run id grouping.** Treating two non-contiguous OSC 8 emissions with the same `id` as one logical link span. Requires a multi-range link type (something like `HyperlinkSpan { id: HyperlinkId, ranges: Vec<RangeInclusive<Point>> }`) and a generalization of `GridHighlightedLink` and the hover/click code to operate on a set of ranges. Deferred because (a) the common case is a single contiguous span, (b) Warp's existing `Link` and the highlighted-link UI assume one contiguous range, and (c) the user-facing benefit is small relative to the breadth of code that would change.
- **Underline-on-hover styling** for OSC 8 spans. Today the spec defers to existing SGR styling. Once the hover state is wired, an additional `Flags::HYPERLINK_HOVER` flag plus a small render change is a clean follow-on.
- **Byte-exact OSC 8 round-trip on copy.** Today the byte-copy path emits a normalized OSC 8 wrapper (see (7)). If we later decide preserving original bytes (params, terminator choice, custom keys) matters, we'd add a per-span byte buffer to the registry. Out of scope for v1.
- **Outgoing OSC 8.** Emitting hyperlinks from Warp's own UI when piping output through the terminal is out of scope for this issue.
