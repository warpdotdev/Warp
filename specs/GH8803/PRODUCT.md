# gh-8803: User-Configurable Custom Language Servers

> Linear ticket not yet created. Filed against GitHub issue [warpdotdev/warp#8803](https://github.com/warpdotdev/warp/issues/8803). Replace this directory with `specs/APP-XXXX/` once a Linear ticket exists.

## Summary

Let users register custom Language Server Protocol (LSP) servers in their Warp settings so the editor can offer code intelligence (diagnostics, hover, go-to-definition, completions) for languages Warp does not ship support for out of the box. Configuration mirrors the shape of Neovim's `vim.lsp.config`: a server name, binary command and arguments, the filetypes it serves, and the workspace root markers it expects. Longer-term, this is the model all language servers — including today's five built-ins — will migrate to; the goal is for LSP support to live in `[[editor.language_servers]]` end-to-end rather than growing the built-in list inside Warp.

## Problem

Warp's editor today only attaches an LSP client for five built-in languages (Rust, Go, Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, C/C++). Anyone working in Ruby, Zig, Lua, Terraform, OCaml, Haskell, Elixir, Swift, Kotlin, Bash, etc. opens a file and gets nothing — no diagnostics, no hover, no completions — even if the appropriate language server is already installed on their machine. Users have no in-app path to fix that.

## Behavior

### Defining a custom server

1. Users can declare one or more custom language servers in their Warp settings file under a new `[[editor.language_servers]]` array-of-tables. Each entry has these fields:
   - `name` (string, required) — A unique identifier for this server within the user's settings, e.g. `"ruby-lsp"`. Used in UI surfaces and log output.
   - `command` (string, required) — Path to the server binary. May be an absolute path or a bare name that will be resolved against the user's `PATH`.
   - `args` (array of strings, optional, defaults to `[]`) — Arguments passed to `command` on launch.
   - `filetypes` (array, required, non-empty) — Patterns that claim files for this server. Each array entry is either a bare **string** pattern, or an **inline table** `{ pattern = "...", language_id = "..." }` where `language_id` is optional. A bare string is equivalent to an inline table with only `pattern` set. The LSP `languageId` Warp sends for matched files is the inline table's `language_id` when provided; otherwise — including for bare strings and for inline tables that omit `language_id` — it defaults to the matched file's lowercase extension, or to the file's literal basename when there is no extension. Use the inline-table form with an explicit `language_id` to override the default, both for servers that expect the LSP-standard identifier (e.g. `{ pattern = "*.rb", language_id = "ruby" }`, `{ pattern = "*.sh", language_id = "shellscript" }`) and for servers that speak multiple languageIds (e.g. `{ pattern = "*.ts", language_id = "typescript" }` and `{ pattern = "*.tsx", language_id = "typescriptreact" }` in the same entry). Every pattern — whether a bare string or the `pattern` field of an inline table — takes one of two syntactic forms:
     - **Glob** — contains any of `*`, `?`, or `[` (e.g. `"*.rb"`, `"*.rake"`, `"Dockerfile.*"`). Matched against the file's basename only (not the full path) using POSIX-style glob semantics — the syntax accepted by Rust's [`glob` crate `Pattern`](https://docs.rs/glob/latest/glob/struct.Pattern.html), which is a strict subset of POSIX.1-2017 §2.13 Pattern Matching Notation. Supported metacharacters are `*` (any sequence of characters except path separators), `?` (any single character), `[abc]` / `[!abc]` (character class / negated class), and `[a-z]` (ranges). Glob matching is case-insensitive — `"*.rb"` matches both `foo.rb` and `FOO.RB`. Brace alternation (`{a,b}`) and double-star recursion (`**`) are **not** supported in v1, since matching is basename-only.
     - **Literal basename** — any pattern that contains none of `*`, `?`, or `[` (e.g. `"Gemfile"`, `"Rakefile"`, `".bashrc"`). Matches files whose basename equals it exactly, case-sensitively. To match files by extension, write a glob (`"*.rb"`, `"*.ts"`); a bare token like `"rb"` is **not** treated as an extension match — it is a literal basename match against a file literally named `rb`.
   - `root_markers` (array of strings, optional, defaults to `[]`) — Filenames or directory names whose presence in an ancestor directory marks the workspace root for this server (e.g. `["Gemfile", ".git"]`). When multiple markers match, the deepest matching ancestor wins; ties resolve to the first marker in the array.
   - `env` (table of string → string, optional, defaults to `{}`) — Extra environment variables merged into the server process's environment on launch.
   - `initialization_options` (arbitrary TOML value, optional) — Passed verbatim as the `initializationOptions` field of the LSP `initialize` request.
   - `workspace_config` (arbitrary TOML value, optional) — The server's runtime workspace configuration. Delivered to the server through two LSP wire paths: as the parameter of the `workspace/didChangeConfiguration` notification (sent once after `initialized`), and as the response body of any `workspace/configuration` request the server pulls. The Warp field is named `workspace_config` (matching the LSP method `workspace/configuration`) instead of mirroring the LSP parameter's wire-protocol name to avoid the awkward `settings`-inside-Warp-settings-file naming clash.

2. `name` must be unique across all entries in `[[editor.language_servers]]`. Two entries with the same `name` are a settings error; see invariant 23.

3. Custom server entries override built-in servers when their `filetypes` overlap with a built-in language. For example, an entry with `filetypes = ["*.rs"]` replaces the built-in `rust-analyzer` mapping for `.rs` files for that user. Removing the custom entry restores the built-in mapping with no further action.

4. When multiple custom entries' `filetypes` patterns could match the same opened file, the first entry in source order in the settings file wins. Built-in language→server mappings are only consulted if no custom entry matches. Overlap between entries is not a settings error — order is the disambiguator.

### Placeholder substitution

5. The string values of `command`, each entry of `args`, each value of `env`, and every string leaf inside `initialization_options` and `workspace_config` undergo template substitution at launch time. Non-string values (numbers, booleans, arrays, tables) inside `initialization_options` and `workspace_config` pass through unchanged; only their string children are substituted. The following placeholders are recognized:
   - `${workspace_root}` — Absolute path to the resolved workspace root (see invariant 12).
   - `${workspace_hash}` — A short stable hash derived from `${workspace_root}`, safe to use as a directory name. Two different workspace roots produce different hashes; the same workspace root produces the same hash across launches.
   - `${cache_dir}` — A per-server, per-user cache directory owned by Warp (e.g. under the OS cache dir, namespaced by the entry's `name`). Warp creates the directory before launch. Suitable as a parent for server scratch state.
   - `${env:VAR}` — The value of environment variable `VAR` in Warp's process environment at launch time. An undefined variable expands to the empty string and is logged.

6. Substitution is single-pass and left-to-right within a string: a substituted value containing `${...}` syntax is not re-expanded. Unknown placeholders (`${...}` patterns that do not match any name above) expand to themselves verbatim and are logged once per launch. The sequence `$$` escapes to a literal `$` — so `$${workspace_root}` in the user's settings produces the seven-character string `${workspace_root}` in the spawned process's args. This is the only escape sequence; a lone `$` not followed by `{` or another `$` is passed through unchanged.

   In addition to `${...}` placeholders, a leading `~` or `~/` at the start of any substituted string expands to the current user's home directory. `~` is expanded only at the very beginning of a value; embedded `~` characters (e.g. `/opt/~/bin`) are passed through unchanged. Other-user home expansion (`~someuser/...`) is not supported. `~` expansion is needed because Warp spawns the server with a direct OS `exec`, not through a shell — without it, `command = "~/bin/lsp-server"` would fail with "no such file or directory."

7. Substitution applies before the process is spawned, after settings validation. A custom entry whose post-substitution `command` resolves to a non-existent path follows the same error path as any other failed launch (see invariant 18).

8. Reordering, adding, or removing entries in the settings file takes effect on the next file open for that filetype. Already-running servers are not restarted by an edit to their entry; users can stop and reopen a file to pick up the new config (see invariant 19).

### Opening a file

9. When the user opens a file in the Warp editor, server resolution proceeds as:
   - If the file matches a built-in language and no custom entry overrides it, behavior is unchanged from today.
   - If the file matches exactly one custom entry's `filetypes` (or matches multiple, with first-in-source-order winning per invariant 4), that custom server is the candidate for this file.
   - If the file matches no entry (built-in or custom), the footer surfaces the same "Language support is unavailable for this file type" state it shows today. No new footer affordance, link, or affordance text is introduced by this feature.

10. The footer's visible behavior, copy, and interaction model are unchanged from today. Custom servers participate in every existing footer surface — status indicator, install progress, the per-workspace Enable button, error messages — via the same code paths built-in servers use. The only difference is that the server's display name and status come from a custom entry instead of a built-in `LSPServerType`.

### Enabling a server per workspace

11. The first time a server (built-in or custom) is a candidate for a workspace root, the footer surfaces the existing "Language support is not currently enabled for `<codebase>`" affordance with its Enable button, unchanged from today. Accepting attaches and persists per-workspace state exactly as it does today for built-ins; custom servers reuse the same persistence and Enable flow.

12. The workspace root used for the enable prompt is the deepest ancestor of the opened file that contains any of the server's `root_markers`. If `root_markers` is empty or no marker is found, the workspace root falls back to the directory currently open in the Warp window (the same root used by built-in servers today).

13. Accepting the prompt persists the choice: that server is automatically enabled for that workspace root on subsequent file opens in the same session and across restarts.

14. Declining the prompt persists for the session: the server is not launched and the prompt does not reappear for that workspace root until the next app launch. v1 has no in-app surface to re-enable a declined server before the next app launch; restart the app to be re-prompted (see non-goal 31).

15. If the user has multiple Warp windows open on the same workspace root, accepting or declining the prompt in one window applies to all of them. A single server process is shared across windows on the same root, consistent with today's built-in behavior.

### Server lifecycle

16. When a server is enabled for a workspace and a matching file is opened, Warp launches the post-substitution `command` with the post-substitution `args`, the merged environment from the user's shell environment and the entry's `env` (also post-substitution), and the working directory set to the resolved workspace root. The server is launched once per workspace root; subsequent file opens reuse it.

17. The LSP `initialize` request sends the resolved workspace root as a `workspaceFolders` entry and passes `initialization_options` verbatim when provided. The `workspace_config` value is delivered to the server via the `workspace/didChangeConfiguration` notification after `initialized`, and is returned as the response body for any `workspace/configuration` request the server makes.

18. If `command` cannot be found on `PATH` (and is not an absolute path), or if the launch fails (non-zero exit before initialization, missing executable bit, etc.), the failure surfaces through the existing footer error path — the same inline error rendering used today for built-in server failures, with the server's `name` and a one-line description of the failure. The editor continues to function without LSP support for that file.

19. Editing or removing an `[[editor.language_servers]]` entry in the settings file does not affect an already-running server for that entry — neither restarting it with new values, nor stopping it on removal. The running server keeps reflecting the configuration from its most recent launch, and continues to serve in-flight requests from open files. New values (or the absence of the entry) take effect only on the next launch, which the user triggers by closing the workspace's editor panes for that filetype and reopening a file, or via an explicit restart action (out of scope to design here; the requirement is that subsequent launches honor the current settings).

### Filetype matching details

20. Filetype matching uses the two forms defined in invariant 1's `filetypes` field: case-insensitive shell-style glob against the basename, and case-sensitive literal basename match. The file's basename is computed from the opened file's path; no other metadata is consulted.

21. Content sniffing (e.g., inspecting a shebang line, parsing file contents to detect language) is out of scope. A bash script named `deploy` with `#!/usr/bin/env bash` at the top is only claimed by a custom entry if `"deploy"` appears in some entry's `filetypes`, or a glob like `"deploy*"` matches. Users who want arbitrary extensionless shell scripts to be claimed must enumerate them.

22. A file whose extension or basename is claimed by a custom entry but whose contents look like a different language (e.g. a `.ts` file that's actually JSON) is still routed by the matched entry. Content sniffing is out of scope per invariant 21.

### Settings validation and errors

23. The following are settings errors and surfaced on settings load:
   - Duplicate `name` across entries.
   - An entry with empty `filetypes`.
   - An entry missing `name` or `command`.
   - An inline-table entry in `filetypes` missing `pattern`.
   - A pattern (string or inline-table) in `filetypes` whose glob form fails to compile as a valid shell-style glob.

   When any entry is invalid, that entry is dropped (other valid entries continue to load), and the user sees an in-app notification listing the invalid entries and the reason for each. The settings file itself is not auto-edited.

24. Unknown fields on an `[[editor.language_servers]]` entry are ignored with a warning logged but no in-app notification. This leaves room to add fields without breaking existing settings files.

25. The settings file's JSON Schema (used by the in-app settings editor's autocomplete and validation) documents every field above, with descriptions and required/optional markers. The schema description for `command`, `args`, `env`, `initialization_options`, and `workspace_config` enumerates the recognized `${...}` placeholders (`${workspace_root}`, `${workspace_hash}`, `${cache_dir}`, `${env:VAR}`), the `$$` escape rule, and the leading-`~`/`~/` home-directory expansion, so users see them in autocomplete hover text and the docs page.

### Non-goals

26. v1 does not install language server binaries on the user's behalf. Users are responsible for making `command` resolvable. Warp may surface install instructions via the docs link from invariant 9 but does not run package managers.

27. v1 does not support per-workspace `.warp/settings.toml` overrides of `[[editor.language_servers]]`. Custom servers are defined at the user level only. Per-workspace overrides are a likely follow-up but not part of this feature.

28. v1 does not support multiple language servers attached to the same file simultaneously (e.g. a linter LSP and a navigation LSP on the same `.rb` file). Neovim allows this; Warp's existing one-server-per-language model is preserved for v1.

29. v1 only supports the stdio transport. The server is launched as a child process and communicates over its stdin/stdout. TCP, named pipes, and other LSP transports are out of scope.

30. v1 does not support merging a custom entry's `initialization_options`, `workspace_config`, or other fields into a built-in server's configuration. A custom entry whose `filetypes` overlap a built-in language fully replaces the built-in server for those filetypes (see invariant 3). Users who want to tune a built-in server's behavior must define a complete custom entry that supplies its own `command`, `args`, and other fields.

31. v1 does not ship a dedicated inspection or management surface (command-palette action, settings sub-page, or status-dropdown extension) for listing which servers are configured and running, resetting per-workspace enable/decline state, or restarting a server for a workspace root. The footer's existing per-workspace Enable button and status dropdown carry over from today's built-in flow and apply to custom servers too; a richer inspection/management surface is deferred to a future release.

## Worked example: Eclipse JDT Language Server (Java)

This example confirms that the fields and placeholder set above are sufficient to launch a non-trivial language server. JDTLS is not a single binary — it ships as a directory tree containing a versioned launcher jar and platform-specific configuration dirs, requires a JDK 21+ runtime, and demands a unique `-data` directory per workspace. A user who has installed JDTLS at `/opt/jdtls` and has `java` on their `PATH` can register it as:

```toml
[[editor.language_servers]]
name = "jdtls"
command = "java"
args = [
  "-Declipse.application=org.eclipse.jdt.ls.core.id1",
  "-Dosgi.bundles.defaultStartLevel=4",
  "-Declipse.product=org.eclipse.jdt.ls.core.product",
  "-Xmx1G",
  "--add-modules=ALL-SYSTEM",
  "--add-opens", "java.base/java.util=ALL-UNNAMED",
  "--add-opens", "java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED",
  "-jar", "/opt/jdtls/plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_1.6.500.v20230717-2134.jar",
  "-configuration", "/opt/jdtls/config_mac_arm",
  "-data", "${cache_dir}/workspaces/${workspace_hash}",
]
filetypes = ["*.java"]
root_markers = [
  "pom.xml",
  "build.gradle", "build.gradle.kts",
  "settings.gradle", "settings.gradle.kts",
  ".classpath", ".project",
  ".git",
]
initialization_options.settings.java.import.gradle.enabled = true
initialization_options.settings.java.import.maven.enabled = true
```

All of `name`, `command`, `args`, `filetypes`, `root_markers`, `initialization_options`, and `workspace_config` are fields of the same `[[editor.language_servers]]` entry — they are not shared with any other custom server. Two custom entries each have their own `initialization_options`; nothing leaks across rows.

Key observations:

- `${workspace_hash}` makes each workspace's `-data` directory unique, which JDTLS requires; without per-workspace substitution, opening a second Java workspace would fail with a lock error.
- The platform-specific `-configuration` path is hardcoded by the user; cross-platform settings sync is out of scope for v1 (see invariant 20's neighborhood — no `${os}`/`${arch}` placeholders are part of v1's minimum set).
- The launcher jar filename is timestamp-versioned. Upgrading JDTLS requires the user to update the path in `args`. This stays the user's responsibility — Warp will not add JDTLS-specific auto-discovery, because the product direction is for all language servers (including ones currently built in) to migrate to the user-configured `[[editor.language_servers]]` model rather than for the built-in list to grow.
- The inner `settings` key in `initialization_options.settings.java.import...` is a JDTLS-specific payload convention, not a Warp field and unrelated to `workspace_config`. JDTLS reads its Java-language configuration from a nested `settings` object inside the LSP `initializationOptions` payload, which is the shape vscode-java, coc-java, and nvim-jdtls all send. The TOML above produces this JSON on the wire in the `initialize` request:
  ```json
  "initializationOptions": {
    "settings": {
      "java": { "import": { "gradle": { "enabled": true }, "maven": { "enabled": true } } }
    }
  }
  ```
  Other servers do not use an inner `settings` wrapper — rust-analyzer, for example, reads its `initializationOptions` flat. The shape inside `initialization_options` (and `workspace_config`) is defined by each server, and Warp passes whatever the user wrote through verbatim.

## Worked examples: today's built-in servers as plugin entries

To validate the migration story stated in the Summary, each of today's five built-in servers can be expressed end-to-end as an `[[editor.language_servers]]` entry against the spec's fields, with no additional spec features required. These examples assume the user has the relevant binary on `PATH`; a node-wrapped install (`command = "node"`, `args = ["<path>/server.js", "--stdio"]`) is the alternative shape for the Node.js-based servers (pyright, typescript-language-server) and works identically.

### rust-analyzer

```toml
[[editor.language_servers]]
name = "rust-analyzer"
command = "rust-analyzer"
filetypes = [{ pattern = "*.rs", language_id = "rust" }]
root_markers = ["Cargo.toml", "rust-project.json", ".git"]
```

### gopls

```toml
[[editor.language_servers]]
name = "gopls"
command = "gopls"
filetypes = [{ pattern = "*.go", language_id = "go" }]
root_markers = ["go.mod", "go.work", ".git"]
```

### pyright

```toml
[[editor.language_servers]]
name = "pyright"
command = "pyright-langserver"
args = ["--stdio"]
filetypes = [{ pattern = "*.py", language_id = "python" }]
root_markers = ["pyproject.toml", "setup.py", "setup.cfg", "requirements.txt", "pyrightconfig.json", ".git"]
```

### typescript-language-server

```toml
[[editor.language_servers]]
name = "typescript-language-server"
command = "typescript-language-server"
args = ["--stdio"]
filetypes = [
  { pattern = "*.ts",  language_id = "typescript" },
  { pattern = "*.tsx", language_id = "typescriptreact" },
  { pattern = "*.js",  language_id = "javascript" },
  { pattern = "*.jsx", language_id = "javascriptreact" },
  { pattern = "*.mjs", language_id = "javascript" },
  { pattern = "*.cjs", language_id = "javascript" },
]
root_markers = ["package.json", "tsconfig.json", "jsconfig.json", ".git"]
```

### clangd

```toml
[[editor.language_servers]]
name = "clangd"
command = "clangd"
filetypes = [
  { pattern = "*.c",   language_id = "c" },
  { pattern = "*.cc",  language_id = "cpp" },
  { pattern = "*.cpp", language_id = "cpp" },
  { pattern = "*.cxx", language_id = "cpp" },
  { pattern = "*.h",   language_id = "cpp" },
  { pattern = "*.hh",  language_id = "cpp" },
  { pattern = "*.hpp", language_id = "cpp" },
  { pattern = "*.hxx", language_id = "cpp" },
]
root_markers = ["compile_commands.json", "compile_flags.txt", ".clangd", ".git"]
```

Notes on the migration mapping:

- Globs match case-insensitively (invariant 1), so `*.c` and `*.h` cover the uppercase variants (`.C`, `.H`) already, no separate entries needed.
- clangd treats `.h` as C++ today (`config.rs:50-54`) because `.h` is genuinely ambiguous; the migrated entry preserves that choice. Users who work in C-heavy codebases can override by editing the entry to map `h` → `c`.
- The TypeScript LSP entry shows the multi-extension/multi-languageId case that motivated the inline-table `filetypes` shape. The same server process handles all six extensions, with each one announced to the server with the correct `languageId`.
- None of the built-in servers need `initialization_options`, `workspace_config`, `env`, or placeholder substitution to function — today's built-in implementation ships none of those. Users who want to tune behavior (e.g. `cargo.features = "all"` for rust-analyzer) add fields as needed without changing the server entry's structure.
