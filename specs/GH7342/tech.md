# GH7342: Tech Spec — Customizable Spinner Verbs
## 1. Context
The implementation customizes only the generic `Warping...` loading label for Warp Agent and Oz. App-launch/startup splash screens and application boot loading surfaces are explicitly out of scope, even if they use similar copy.
Relevant code:
- `app/src/settings/ai.rs` defines the public `custom_warping_verbs` setting at `agents.warp_agent.custom_warping_verbs`.
- `app/src/ai/loading/warping_verb.rs` owns `DEFAULT_WARPING_VERB`, normalization constants, normalization helpers, render-time formatting, and `WarpingVerbSelector`.
- `app/src/ai/loading/warping_verb_pack.rs` owns the read-only built-in packs.
- `app/src/ai/blocklist/block/status_bar.rs` owns a `WarpingVerbSelector` and passes the resolved generic fallback string into `WarpingProps`.
- `app/src/ai/blocklist/block/view_impl/common.rs` keeps action-specific loading labels ahead of `props.default_warping_text`.
- `app/src/settings_view/ai_page.rs` renders the Settings UI mode buttons and custom editor.
## 2. Settings Contract
The single persisted user-facing setting is:
- Name: `custom_warping_verbs`
- TOML path: `agents.warp_agent.custom_warping_verbs`
- Type: `Vec<String>`
- Default: empty list
- Supported platforms: all
- Sync: global, respecting the user's sync preference
- Feature flag: `FeatureFlag::CustomWarpingVerbs`
An empty list means "use the built-in default", which resolves to `DEFAULT_WARPING_VERB` (`Warping...`).
There is no hidden-mode setting and no serialized pack enum. Applying a pack writes that pack's verb strings into `custom_warping_verbs`, so older/newer clients still interpret the value as a plain custom list.
## 3. Normalization
`AISettings::set_custom_warping_verbs` is the canonical write path for Settings UI and agent-driven updates. It calls `normalize_warping_verbs`.
`WarpingVerbSelector::resolve_from_verbs` also normalizes before picking a display value. This second normalization is required because settings-file edits and synced values can bypass `AISettings::set_custom_warping_verbs`.
Normalization rules are implemented in `app/src/ai/loading/warping_verb.rs`:
- Trim each entry.
- Strip trailing `.` and `…` characters.
- Drop entries that are empty after trimming and stripping.
- Truncate each entry to `MAX_WARPING_VERB_CHARS`.
- Sentence-capitalize the first character.
- Truncate again after capitalization to preserve the max length.
- Keep at most `MAX_CUSTOM_WARPING_VERBS` entries.
`format_for_display` appends `...` unless the normalized selected phrase already ends with `.`, `!`, `?`, or `…`.
## 4. Built-In Packs
`WarpingVerbPack` defines four read-only packs:
- `medieval`
- `conspiracy`
- `cooking`
- `warpy`
Packs expose:
- `all()` for Settings UI display order.
- `display_name()` for button labels.
- `identifier()` for natural-language setting descriptions and skill routing.
- `verbs()` for static source values.
- `verbs_as_vec()` for writing a pack into `custom_warping_verbs`.
Agents handling natural-language "spinner verbs", "warping verbs", or "flavor verbs" requests should modify `agents.warp_agent.custom_warping_verbs` through the settings path. They should not edit source pack definitions unless the developer explicitly asks to change built-in packs.
## 5. Rendering Flow
`BlocklistAIStatusBar` stores a `WarpingVerbSelector`.
When rendering the latest exchange:
1. `resolve_fallback_warping_message` is evaluated first.
2. If fallback-model text exists, that exact model-specific text becomes `default_warping_text`, and the fallback explanation is rendered as secondary content.
3. Otherwise, `warping_verb_session_key_for_exchange` chooses a stable session key from the active response stream or exchange.
4. `WarpingVerbSelector::resolve` returns one selected custom phrase for that session, or `DEFAULT_WARPING_VERB` if the feature is disabled or the normalized list is empty.
5. The resolved string is passed to `render_warping_indicator` as `WarpingProps::default_warping_text`.
`render_warping_indicator` keeps all specific states above the generic fallback, including summarization, document generation/update, passive code diff, file edit request, ask-user-question preparation, web search, review-comment fetching, interrupt adjustment, codebase search, grep, MCP call/resource read, file glob, writing to long-running commands, command execution, command waiting, and waiting-for-user-input states.
Only the final generic fallback branch uses `props.default_warping_text`.
## 6. Selector Semantics
`WarpingVerbSelector` caches:
- `session_key`
- raw selected phrase
- formatted display phrase
If the same session key renders again, it returns the cached display phrase. When the session key changes, it picks from the normalized list. With more than one candidate, it filters out the previously selected raw phrase when possible to avoid an immediate repeat.
The selector clears its cache and returns `DEFAULT_WARPING_VERB` when `FeatureFlag::CustomWarpingVerbs` is disabled or the normalized list is empty.
## 7. Settings UI
`AISettingsPageView` tracks `spinner_verb_mode` with:
- `Default`
- `Pack(WarpingVerbPack)`
- `Custom`
The mode is derived from the stored list:
- Empty list maps to `Default`.
- A list exactly matching a built-in pack maps to that `Pack`.
- Any other non-empty list maps to `Custom`.
The `Spinner verbs` widget renders mode buttons and either:
- a default preview,
- a pack preview,
- or a custom comma-separated editor.
Custom editor behavior:
- User edits switch the local mode to `Custom` and set `custom_warping_verb_editor_has_user_edits`.
- Blur and Enter save through `save_custom_warping_verbs_from_editor`.
- Selecting Default or a pack clears the dirty flag and resets the editor to empty text.
- External `AISettingsChangedEvent::CustomWarpingVerbs` updates mode and editor text only when there are no unsaved user edits.
This prevents stale custom editor text after external updates while also avoiding persistence on every keystroke.
## 8. Settings File Behavior
Example:
```toml
[agents.warp_agent]
custom_warping_verbs = ["Sautéing", "Braising", "Fermenting"]
```
Settings hot reload uses the existing public-settings path. Raw values are normalized at render time even if they were not written through the UI setter.
Invalid or unsupported values should follow the repository's existing settings-file error behavior. Valid arrays that normalize to an empty list fall back to `Warping...`.
## 9. Tests and Validation
Unit coverage should include:
- `normalize_warping_verb` trimming, trailing-dot stripping, dots-only dropping, sentence capitalization, unicode safety, and truncation.
- `normalize_warping_verbs` empty filtering and max-list capping.
- selector default fallback when the feature is disabled or list is empty.
- selector per-session stability.
- selector no-immediate-repeat behavior when alternatives exist.
- selector renderer-boundary normalization for raw settings/synced values.
- pack identifiers, display names, and pack contents.
Manual validation should cover:
- Settings UI mode switching.
- Custom editor save on blur/Enter.
- External settings-file edits while the custom editor has and does not have unsaved changes.
- Generic warping text in local Warp Agent and Oz/cloud-agent flows.
- Specific status messages and fallback-model messages overriding custom verbs.
Suggested targeted commands:
- `cargo test --manifest-path /Users/erica/warp/Cargo.toml -p app warping_verb`
- `cargo test --manifest-path /Users/erica/warp/Cargo.toml -p app warping_verb_pack`
Before pushing PR updates, run formatting and clippy using the repository-standard commands.
## 10. Risks and Mitigations
- Risk: custom verbs replace useful status labels. Mitigation: keep custom text only at the final generic fallback branch.
- Risk: raw synced/settings-file values bypass UI normalization. Mitigation: normalize again in `WarpingVerbSelector::resolve_from_verbs`.
- Risk: the Settings UI shows stale custom text after external updates. Mitigation: track unsaved user edits and sync editor text only when safe.
- Risk: phrase changes reset shimmer every render. Mitigation: cache one display phrase per session key.
- Risk: natural-language agents modify third-party spinner config instead of Warp's setting. Mitigation: document `agents.warp_agent.custom_warping_verbs` as the canonical handler in the setting description and bundled settings skill.
## 11. Follow-ups
- Product/Design can revise built-in pack contents before broader rollout.
- A future feature can add a separate hidden/suppress mode if users request it.
- A future feature can address app-launch/startup splash copy if Product wants that surface to be configurable.
