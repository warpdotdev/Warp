//! Logic relating to a secondary process which Warp uses to spawn new shell
//! sessions.
//!
//! The purpose of this "server" process is to ensure that shell processes are
//! created in as clean of a state as possible.  In general, the act of creating
//! a new process in Unix "leaks" some state from the parent into the child
//! (e.g.: open file descriptors).  By spawning this secondary process very
//! early during Warp's initialization, we can be more confident that there are
//! no resources that will leak into shell processes (and, subsequently, into
//! the programs the user runs within the shell).
//!
//! ## Important Notes
//!
//! All reads and writes _must_ be paired, otherwise the app can end up
//! deadlocked waiting for a response that never arrives.  The APIs here can be
//! better designed to make it impossible for this to occur (e.g.: encapsulate
//! the receive/send pair in a single function which delegates to helpers that
//! transform a request into a response), but until then, newly added code will
//! need to enforce this invariant.
