/// The executor is always constructed with a live `RemoteServerClient` that
/// was obtained from [`crate::remote_server::manager::RemoteServerManager`]
/// after the session reached the `Connected` state. The manager owns the
/// authoritative per-session client; this executor holds a cloned `Arc` to
/// the same underlying channels and transitively keeps them alive as long
/// as the `Session` is alive.
///
/// If the underlying SSH connection is torn down mid-session,
/// [`RemoteServerClient::run_command`] will fail naturally and
/// [`execute_command`] surfaces that as an `Err`. We deliberately do *not*
/// silently synthesize an empty `Ok(CommandOutput)` for the disconnected
/// case, because callers (notably the completions/syntax-highlighting
/// pipeline) treat `Ok(empty)` as "there are zero top-level commands" and
/// produce incorrect results.
