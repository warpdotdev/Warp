/// Interfaces that allow us to interact with global resources owned by the main
/// thread that exist throughout the app including Model handles, channel senders,
/// channel receivers, and references.
///
/// Guidelines:
/// * If it doesn't need to be a global resource (e.g. it could be owned by a view),
///   it shouldn't go here.
///
/// * Use a Model if you have a global data model. You can use ModelHandle#update
///   to mutate it, ModelHandle#read to borrow it, and ViewContext#observe to
///   have a view respond to all updates to the model. A lot of things in the
///   app will be Models, but they won't necessarily need to be global in the app.
///   One example of a global model is the referral theme status: there will only
///   be one value throughout the app on whether the user has activated a referral
///   theme. One example of a model owned by a view is the terminal sessions model:
///   since this is metadata about particular shell sessions that are in a particular
///   pane, they belong to that pane's terminal view.
///
/// * Use a Sender if you need to send communication from the main thread to
///   another thread. For example, we send `ModelEvent`s to the sqlite writer
///   thread.
///
/// * Use a Receiver if you need to receive communication in the main thread
///   sent from another thread. This would need to be used in conjunction with
///   `ViewContext#spawn_stream_local` which polls the receiver for values.
///   One example use case could be receiving updates from the warp config watcher
///   thread. Note that `spawn_stream_local` is polling on the main thread, so
///   we should call this sparingly. It's easy to unintentionally call this from
///   a view that's instantiated many times in the app (e.g. EditorView). Instead
///   of doing that, we should ideally find a view that's only created once
///   per-window and propagate changes down the view hierarchy by calling update
///   on the view handles of that view's children.
///
/// * Use an Arc if you need to share data with another thread. Note that in
///   order to mutate anything under the Arc, you'll need a Mutex or RwLock.
///
/// * watch::Channel is not recommended as it creates a lot of implicit clones.
///   It actually also includes a Sender, Receiver, Arc, and a RwLock. Instead of
///   using watch::Channel, consider what of the use cases listed above are
///   relevant.
