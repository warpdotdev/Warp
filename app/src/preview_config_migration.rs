//! One-time migration that gives the Preview channel its own config
//! directory (`~/.warp-preview`) on macOS.
//!
//! Historically, Stable and Preview shared `~/.warp` on macOS. To give
//! Preview its own directory without breaking existing users, this migration
//! symlinks each top-level entry from `~/.warp` into `~/.warp-preview` on
//! first launch, so existing configuration (keybindings, themes, workflows,
//! etc.) remains available to Preview.
//!
//! See `specs/QUALITY-408/` for full context.
