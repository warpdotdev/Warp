//! IPC service for calling JS functions registered by Warp plugins.
//!
//! This service is hosted by the plugin host process and used by the main app process to call
//! plugin functions defined in JS.
//!
//! Functions are called by a given `JsFunctionId`; this service does not enforce correctness of
//! given IDs. Valid IDs are expected to be passed from plugin host process to app process by some
//! other means (e.g. some other service). For example, IDs for Command Signature generator
//! functions are contained within `CommandSignature` structs passed from plugin host to app via
//! the `RegisterCommandSignature` service.
//!
//! Similarly, this service does not enforce correctness of input/output types; the caller is
//! expected to call a function with its expected input type and deserialize its output bytes
//! correctly.
//!
//! To serialize input/deserialize output, callers are expected to use `bincode`.
