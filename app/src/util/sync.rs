/// A set-once asynchronous condition variable.
///
/// Generally, a [condition variable](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2012fa/recitations/rec16.html)
/// lets tasks wait until some condition becomes true (for example, we might want to wait for the
/// user to have logged in, or for the initial load of Warp Drive objects to have finished). When
/// the condition becomes true, one or all of the waiting tasks can wake up and do their work.
///
/// This [`Condition`] implementation models the simpler case where a condition becomes true and
/// is then *always* true (unless reset explicitly). This allows waiting for something to happen at least once. If a task
/// starts waiting before the condition is met, it will block, but if the condition is already true,
/// it continues immediately.
///
/// We use this in Warp Drive to wait for the initial load of changed objects to finish. Regular UI
/// framework events aren't suitable, because they don't tell us if the load had *already*
/// finished - a task that subscribed too late would block forever!
///
/// Also see [`std::sync::Condvar`].
