  # fish doesn't allow setting variables with `=`, so the easiest cross-shell compatible expression is
  # this oneliner.
  # Making this cross-shell compatible is a bit complicated: we need the surrounding curly braces to
  # fix precedence issues between `||` and `|`, but curly braces are processed differently in fish.
  # Thankfully, we don't need curly braces around the first expression, so we can put the fish check
  # first and it early exits. This runs correctly in sh, bash, zsh, and fish.
  # Replace `HOOK_NAME` with the appropriate hook name.
