/// enclosing autorelease pool is drained. AppKit's main event loop and GCD
/// blocks create one of these pools around each callback, so most code doesn't
/// have to think about it. But code that runs during app startup, on a thread
/// Rust created itself, or in a tight loop inside a single event can't rely on
/// the outer pool: objects accumulate in memory until that outer pool drains,
/// which can be a long time.

/// guard drains the pool automatically when it goes out of scope, whether the
/// function returns normally, returns early via `?`, or unwinds due to a
