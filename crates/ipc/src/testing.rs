//! Mock implementation of `ServiceCaller` for use in tests.
//!
//! This requires service request to implement `Hash`, `PartialEq`, `Eq` to make assertions about
//! expected requests.
//!
//! If any unexpected request is called, then the caller panics. Additionally, if any expected
//! requests were _not_ actually called, the caller panics upon being dropped.
//!
//! Usage:
//!
//! ```
//! let mock_caller = MockServiceCaller::<MyService>::new();
//! mock_caller.expect_response(MyRequest { foo: "bar" }, MyResponse { bar: "baz" });
//! ```
