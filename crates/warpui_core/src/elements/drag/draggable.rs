/// A container element that can be freely dragged and dropped around the screen
///
/// Dragging starts when the mouse is held down and dragged at least a threshold distance (default
/// 5 pixels) away from where it started. Dragging stops when the mouse is released.
///
/// ## Layout and Painting
///
/// While dragging, the Element is still laid out using its original position in the Element tree,
/// however it is painted at the location of the mouse. Once dragging stops, it returns to being
/// painted in the normal tree element position (i.e. the dragged position is not maintained after
/// dragging stops).
///
/// ## Limiting the Draggable Area
///
/// There are two complementary ways to limit the space that the Element can be dragged:
///
/// 1. Specifying a drag axis so that the Element can only be dragged in one direction.
/// 2. Specifying bounds that limit the Element to only dragging within a specific rectangle.
///
/// ### Fixed Axis
///
/// To limit the Draggable to only move in a single direction, call `with_drag_axis` and pass it
/// the appropriate direction (either `DragAxis::HorizontalOnly` or `DragAxis::VerticalOnly`). The
/// Element will be able to freely move in the given direction, but will not move at all in the
/// perpendicular direction.
///
/// ### Bounding Box
///
/// To specify a bounding box in which the Element is confined, call either:
///
/// * `with_drag_bounds` - Takes a fixed `RectF` value and uses that for the bounds.
/// * `with_drag_bounds_callback` - Takes a callback—which accepts a `&StackContext` and the window
///   size—that returns an `Option<RectF>` to indicate the bounds (or lack thereof).
///
/// In either case, if a bounding rectangle exists, the Element will be confined to only drag
/// completely within that rectangle. If it happens that the bounding box is smaller than the
/// Element, the top-left corner will be fixed within the bounding box and any overflow will happen
/// to the right or below the bounds.
///
/// If you specify a callback for calculating the bounds, it will be called each time the Element
/// is painted and the value will be cached for subsequent events.
///
/// ## Callbacks
///
/// There are three event callbacks that can be used to react to dragging:
///
/// - `on_drag_start`: Called when the `drag_threshold` is crossed and dragging begins.
/// - `on_drag`: Called on mouse move while dragging.
/// - `on_drop`: Called on mouse up when dragging stops. If the `Draggable` was dropped on
///   a [`crate::elements::DropTarget`] the data of that `DropTarget` is passed as a parameter.
///
/// All of the callbacks receive three parameters:
///
/// - An `&mut EventContext`
/// - An `&AppContext`
/// - A `RectF` representing the current painted position and size of the Element.
///
/// Note: For `on_drag_start`, the `RectF` passed will be the original position of the Element when
/// the mouse was first pressed, not the shifted position after crossing the threshold.
///
/// ## Child Events
///
/// While this element is actively being dragged, all events to the child Element will be
/// suppressed, the drag behavior will take precedence over any other events.
///
///
/// ## Drop Targets
///
/// `Draggable`s can optionally be dropped on [`crate::elements::DropTarget`]s. When dropped, the
/// [`:DropTargetData`] of the `DropTarget` is included as a parameter to identify the `DropTarget`
/// the element was dropped on.
