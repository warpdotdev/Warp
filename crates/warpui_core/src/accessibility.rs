//! # What is accessibility?
//! Accessibility (or a11y) is the umbrella term used to describe features that enable people with
//! disabilities to use certain software. In our case: we focus on blind users and their day-to-day
//! life with screen readers.
//!
//! ## How does a11y work in Warp?
//! Because Warp uses its own rust UI framework (warpui), we don’t benefit from the built-in
//! VoiceOver integration and objc NSAccessibility APIs. This is both good and bad for our app and
//! the UI framework.
//!
//! Good parts:
//! - We actually had to think on how to add support to the UI framework to make it easier for future
//!   app developers to not overlook a11y;
//! - We don’t rely on complicated defaults and the cumbersome experience of analyzing all the UI
//!   elements in the app, instead we can provide a more ergonomic experience to blind users.
//!
//! Bad parts:
//! - It takes time to implement the full support (for example, we still lack the ability to focus a
//!   certain UI element, like a button, and “click it” or otherwise act on it with just the keyboard);
//! - We need to think about a11y (yeah, I mentioned it in good parts, but given that a11y is usually
//!   thirdwheeling next to AwesomeFeatures™ and BugFixes® it’s easy to ship features that are not accessible).
//!
//! WarpUI framework right now provides 3 ways of announcing what’s happening in the app:
//! - Accessibility Contents for the currently focused View;
//! - Accessibility Contents for the currently performed Action;
//! - On-demand emitting Accessibility Contents.
//!
//! ## Testing for a11y
//! We don’t have (and I don’t know if such a thing even exists) a way to automatically test a11y
//! features. To test it then, we just need to run the app and run VoiceOver.
//!
//! To run it - go to your System Preferences -> Accessibility -> VoiceOver, and then click
//! “Enable VoiceOver”. Note that it may be loud and distracting. It’s sometimes easier to turn off
//! the sound, and check the content of the tiny rectangle that will show on your screen together
//! with VoiceOver.
//!
//! ### What to look for?
//! - Whenever a new view opens, the user will get the information about what’s happening;
//! - The feature is keyboard accessible (a good practice would be to have it in the command palette);
//! - Any meaningful changes to the state of feature are announced (both triggered by a user’s
//!   Action or a background Event);
//! - The user can quit the feature and get back to the command input with keyboard (a good
//!   practice would be to keep it consistent among all the features, and quit via Escape key);
//! - User docs mention whether the feature is accessible (on the feature’s page) and what’s the
//!   keybinding to access it;
//! - If there’s a video/GIF in the user docs, make sure that its content is also reflected in text.
