//! Automatic change tracking (autotracking) system to reduce the need to call `ctx.notify()`
//!
//! This module provides a wrapper type `Tracked`, which automatically tracks changes to the
//! underlying data and invalidates any Views that depend on that data (the equivalent of calling
//! `ctx.notify()` directly).
//!
//! ## Use
//!
//! The `Tracked` type is intended to be straightforward to use: Any data that is wrapped in a
//! `Tracked` will be hooked into the Autotracking system and will not need any calls to `notify`
//! from any views that depend on the data for rendering. Creating a `Tracked` can be done in two
//! ways:
//!
//! 1. Directly using the `Tracked::new` constructor, e.g. `Tracked::new(true)`
//! 2. Via `Into`, e.g. `true.into()`
//!
//! `Tracked` implements `Deref` and `DerefMut` for the underlying type, so in most cases you
//! should be able to use it directly wherever the underlying data would be expected. It may
//! require an explicit dereference (e.g. `*my_value`) in some cases, but other than that the
//! intent is for it to be mostly transparent.
//!
//! See the `autotracking` example in the `examples/` directory for more.
//!
//! ## Limitations
//!
//! `Tracked` is currently single-threaded, meaning that all of the values you want to have
//! automatically tracked must be on the main thread of the app. This should apply to anything
//! stored in a Model or View, as those are owned by the main thread already. To ensure that
//! autotracked data is not incorrectly shared between threads, `Tracked` explicitly does not
//! implement `Send` or `Sync`.
//!
//! Additionally, `Tracked` currently detects any mutable _access_ to the data as an update. It
//! explicitly does not do any diff of the data to determine if there was an actual change made.
//! This means it could generate false positive updates if you update it to the same values or
//! otherwise take mutable access without modifying the data.
//!
//! Similar to the above, since `Tracked` relies on _mutable_ access, it will not detect changes
//! in a type that uses interior mutability to make changes through a shared reference (`&self`
//! instead of `&mut self`).
//!
//! ## Granularity
//!
//! Since `Tracked` can wrap any type, it is up to the user to determine how granular you want the
//! tracking to be. It can wrap each individual value to give you very granular updates when only
//! specific dependencies are changed, or it can wrap an entire model and give coarse updates
//! whenever the model is modified.
//!
//! ## Details
//!
//! Internally, the Autotracking system works by tracking access in two ways:
//!
//! 1. While a View is rendering, any _reads_ of `Tracked` data are cached as dependencies for that
//!    view.
//! 2. When any `Tracked` data is _updated_, all Views that depended on that data are marked for
//!    invalidation.
//!
//! ### `Tracked`
//!
//! To track reads and updates, each instance of a `Tracked` includes a unique identifier used by
//! the autotracking system. The `Deref` and `DerefMut` implementations for `Tracked` send that
//! identifier to the Autotracking system indicating a read or update, respectively. The fact that
//! the tracking is tied to `Deref` and `DerefMut` is the reason behind the limitation listed above
//! that it could generate false-positive results.
//!
//! ### Reads
//!
//! In order to track reads and cache dependencies, whenever the UI Framework begins rendering a
//! View (i.e. calling `View::render` on it), it first notifies the Autotracking system that a
//! render is starting. The autotracking system clears the cache for that View and holds onto the
//! `WindowId` and `ViewId` for the duration of the render. During that time, any reads of
//! `Tracked` data result in the autotracking cache being updated to list that tracked data as a
//! dependency of the rendering view.
//!
//! When the call to `View::render` is complete, the UI Framework notifies the Autotracking system
//! that it's over and it stops associating reads with a View dependency.
//!
//! ### Updates
//!
//! Whenever a `Tracked` data is updated, the Autotracking system adds all views that depend on
//! that data to a set of invalidations. Then, every time the UI Framework collects the manual
//! invalidations (e.g. those created by calls to `ctx.notify()`), it also drains the stored
//! invalidations from the autotracking system. From that point forward, they are treated exactly
//! the same as if you had called `ctx.notify()` for the relevant views.
//!
//! ### Removing Views
//!
//! When the UI Framework removes a view or window, it notifies the Autotracking system of that
//! removal and any Views that no longer exist are removed from the dependency cache. This ensures
//! that we aren't wasting resources trying to invalidate views that no longer exist.
//!
//! ### Cache
//!
//! All of the Autotracking cached data is stored in a thread-local static on the main thread. This
//! removes the need for synchronization (e.g. `Mutex` or `RwLock`), as the data will only ever be
//! accessed by a single thread. This also allows the `Tracked` instances to notify about any reads
//! or updates without having to maintain a reference to the `AppContext` or similar app
//! state. However, this is also the source of the limitation that all data using `Tracked` must
//! be on the main thread and the lack of support for multithreaded change tracking.
