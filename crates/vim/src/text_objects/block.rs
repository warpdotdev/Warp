/// of [`BracketType`], not including the brackets themselves.
/// See https://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/motion.html#ib
/// or enter ":help i{" in Vim.
///
/// There may be whitespace in within the brackets which is also not included. If the closing
/// bracket is on a different line then the opening bracket, and there is only whitespace between
/// the closing bracket and the newline preceding it, all that space plus the newline are _not_
/// included in the text object. (AFAIK this is not documented.) We can refer to that space as
/// "trailing padding". Furthermore, the `c` and `d` commands differ in how they respect "leading
/// padding", i.e. the whitespace plus newline after the opening bracket, in that `d` will delete
/// the leading padding but `c` will not. The `preserve_leading_padding` parameter controls this.
///
/// Returns None when the buffer is empty, the offset is out of bounds, or there is no matching
/// pair of brackets of the type we're looking for around the cursor.
