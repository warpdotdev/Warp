/// A helper structure that wraps the underlying grid content and provides
/// higher-level APIs for accessing the data.
///
/// Internally, this stores content in a series of chunks.  By chunking up
/// the content, we can efficiently trim data off the _front_ of the content
/// string without having to make any (expensive) copies.
///
/// From the outside, this structure is best conceptualized as a non-circular
/// circular buffer, keyed by content offset.  The start of the buffer is
/// pointed to by `active_chunk.start_offset + active_chunk.len`, and the end
/// of the buffer is pointed to by the `content_offset` of the first entry in
/// the flat storage [`Index`](super::Index).  We never "re-zero" the offsets
/// in the buffer, and so the tail pointer only ever moves forward.  (The head
/// pointer can move backwards when we pop rows off of the end of flat storage,
/// and so remove content from the end of the buffer.)
///
/// [`Content::push_grapheme`] inserts new content and moves the head pointer
/// forwards; [`Content::truncate`] moves the head pointer backwards.  The tail
/// pointer isn't directly modified within this structure, as it is owned by
/// [`super::Index`].  When rows are dropped from the index, this structure is
/// notified via a call to [`Content::truncate_front`], which drops any chunks
/// which entirely precede the new tail pointer.
