/// to be eligible to be matched to a command signature. So, for example, if the input does not
/// contain trailing whitespace, the last token is not considered in the matching algorithm.

/// return the signature for the shorter subcommand even if the intent was to continue typing to
/// enter the longer subcommand.

/// subcommand signature for "test_subcommand", this returns the signature for "test_command",
/// because it's assumed "test_subcommand" may still be edited.
