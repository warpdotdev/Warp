//! Traits, helpers, and type definitions for core I/O functionality.
//!
//! The `std::io` module contains a number of common things you'll need
//! when doing input and output. The most core part of this module is
//! the [`Read`] and [`Write`] traits, which provide the
//! most general interface for reading and writing input and output.
//!
//! ## Read and Write
//!
//! Because they are traits, [`Read`] and [`Write`] are implemented by a number
//! of other types, and you can implement them for your types too. As such,
//! you'll see a few different types of I/O throughout the documentation in
//! this module: [`File`]s, [`TcpStream`]s, and sometimes even [`Vec<T>`]s. For
//! example, [`Read`] adds a [`read`][`Read::read`] method, which we can use on
//! [`File`]s:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::io;
//! use std::io::prelude::*;
//! use std::fs::File;
//!
//! fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
//!     let mut f = File::open("foo.txt")?;
//!     let mut buffer = [0; 10];
//!
//!     // read up to 10 bytes
//!     let n = f.read(&mut buffer)?;
//!
//!     println!("The bytes: {:?}", &buffer[..n]);
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! [`Read`] and [`Write`] are so important, implementors of the two traits have a
//! nickname: readers and writers. So you'll sometimes see 'a reader' instead
//! of 'a type that implements the [`Read`] trait'. Much easier!
//!
//! ## Seek and BufRead
//!
//! Beyond that, there are two important traits that are provided: [`Seek`]
//! and [`BufRead`]. Both of these build on top of a reader to control
//! how the reading happens. [`Seek`] lets you control where the next byte is
//! coming from:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::io;
//! use std::io::prelude::*;
//! use std::io::SeekFrom;
//! use std::fs::File;
//!
//! fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
//!     let mut f = File::open("foo.txt")?;
//!     let mut buffer = [0; 10];
//!
//!     // skip to the last 10 bytes of the file
//!     f.seek(SeekFrom::End(-10))?;
//!
//!     // read up to 10 bytes
//!     let n = f.read(&mut buffer)?;
//!
//!     println!("The bytes: {:?}", &buffer[..n]);
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! [`BufRead`] uses an internal buffer to provide a number of other ways to read, but
//! to show it off, we'll need to talk about buffers in general. Keep reading!
//!
//! ## BufReader and BufWriter
//!
//! Byte-based interfaces are unwieldy and can be inefficient, as we'd need to be
//! making near-constant calls to the operating system. To help with this,
//! `std::io` comes with two structs, [`BufReader`] and [`BufWriter`], which wrap
//! readers and writers. The wrapper uses a buffer, reducing the number of
//! calls and providing nicer methods for accessing exactly what you want.
//!
//! For example, [`BufReader`] works with the [`BufRead`] trait to add extra
//! methods to any reader:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::io;
//! use std::io::prelude::*;
//! use std::io::BufReader;
//! use std::fs::File;
//!
//! fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
//!     let f = File::open("foo.txt")?;
//!     let mut reader = BufReader::new(f);
//!     let mut buffer = String::new();
//!
//!     // read a line into buffer
//!     reader.read_line(&mut buffer)?;
//!
//!     println!("{buffer}");
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! [`BufWriter`] doesn't add any new ways of writing; it just buffers every call
//! to [`write`][`Write::write`]:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::io;
//! use std::io::prelude::*;
//! use std::io::BufWriter;
//! use std::fs::File;
//!
//! fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
//!     let f = File::create("foo.txt")?;
//!     {
//!         let mut writer = BufWriter::new(f);
//!
//!         // write a byte to the buffer
//!         writer.write(&[42])?;
//!
//!     } // the buffer is flushed once writer goes out of scope
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Standard input and output
//!
//! A very common source of input is standard input:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::io;
//!
//! fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
//!     let mut input = String::new();
//!
//!     io::stdin().read_line(&mut input)?;
//!
//!     println!("You typed: {}", input.trim());
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Note that you cannot use the [`?` operator] in functions that do not return
//! a [`Result<T, E>`][`Result`]. Instead, you can call [`.unwrap()`]
//! or `match` on the return value to catch any possible errors:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::io;
//!
//! let mut input = String::new();
//!
//! io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! And a very common source of output is standard output:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::io;
//! use std::io::prelude::*;
//!
//! fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
//!     io::stdout().write(&[42])?;
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Of course, using [`io::stdout`] directly is less common than something like
//! [`println!`].
//!
//! ## Iterator types
//!
//! A large number of the structures provided by `std::io` are for various
//! ways of iterating over I/O. For example, [`Lines`] is used to split over
//! lines:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::io;
//! use std::io::prelude::*;
//! use std::io::BufReader;
//! use std::fs::File;
//!
//! fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
//!     let f = File::open("foo.txt")?;
//!     let reader = BufReader::new(f);
//!
//!     for line in reader.lines() {
//!         println!("{}", line?);
//!     }
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Functions
//!
//! There are a number of [functions][functions-list] that offer access to various
//! features. For example, we can use three of these functions to copy everything
//! from standard input to standard output:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::io;
//!
//! fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
//!     io::copy(&mut io::stdin(), &mut io::stdout())?;
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! [functions-list]: #functions-1
//!
//! ## io::Result
//!
//! Last, but certainly not least, is [`io::Result`]. This type is used
//! as the return type of many `std::io` functions that can cause an error, and
//! can be returned from your own functions as well. Many of the examples in this
//! module use the [`?` operator]:
//!
//! ```
//! use std::io;
//!
//! fn read_input() -> io::Result<()> {
//!     let mut input = String::new();
//!
//!     io::stdin().read_line(&mut input)?;
//!
//!     println!("You typed: {}", input.trim());
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The return type of `read_input()`, [`io::Result<()>`][`io::Result`], is a very
//! common type for functions which don't have a 'real' return value, but do want to
//! return errors if they happen. In this case, the only purpose of this function is
//! to read the line and print it, so we use `()`.
//!
//! ## Platform-specific behavior
//!
//! Many I/O functions throughout the standard library are documented to indicate
//! what various library or syscalls they are delegated to. This is done to help
//! applications both understand what's happening under the hood as well as investigate
//! any possibly unclear semantics. Note, however, that this is informative, not a binding
//! contract. The implementation of many of these functions are subject to change over
//! time and may call fewer or more syscalls/library functions.
//!
//! ## I/O Safety
//!
//! Rust follows an I/O safety discipline that is comparable to its memory safety discipline. This
//! means that file descriptors can be *exclusively owned*. (Here, "file descriptor" is meant to
//! subsume similar concepts that exist across a wide range of operating systems even if they might
//! use a different name, such as "handle".) An exclusively owned file descriptor is one that no
//! other code is allowed to access in any way, but the owner is allowed to access and even close
//! it any time. A type that owns its file descriptor should usually close it in its `drop`
//! function. Types like [`File`] own their file descriptor. Similarly, file descriptors
//! can be *borrowed*, granting the temporary right to perform operations on this file descriptor.
//! This indicates that the file descriptor will not be closed for the lifetime of the borrow, but
//! it does *not* imply any right to close this file descriptor, since it will likely be owned by
//! someone else.
//!
//! The platform-specific parts of the Rust standard library expose types that reflect these
//! concepts, see [`os::unix`] and [`os::windows`].
//!
//! To uphold I/O safety, it is crucial that no code acts on file descriptors it does not own or
//! borrow, and no code closes file descriptors it does not own. In other words, a safe function
//! that takes a regular integer, treats it as a file descriptor, and acts on it, is *unsound*.
//!
//! Not upholding I/O safety and acting on a file descriptor without proof of ownership can lead to
//! misbehavior and even Undefined Behavior in code that relies on ownership of its file
//! descriptors: a closed file descriptor could be re-allocated, so the original owner of that file
//! descriptor is now working on the wrong file. Some code might even rely on fully encapsulating
//! its file descriptors with no operations being performed by any other part of the program.
//!
//! Note that exclusive ownership of a file descriptor does *not* imply exclusive ownership of the
//! underlying kernel object that the file descriptor references (also called "open file description" on
//! some operating systems). File descriptors basically work like [`Arc`]: when you receive an owned
//! file descriptor, you cannot know whether there are any other file descriptors that reference the
//! same kernel object. However, when you create a new kernel object, you know that you are holding
//! the only reference to it. Just be careful not to lend it to anyone, since they can obtain a
//! clone and then you can no longer know what the reference count is! In that sense, [`OwnedFd`] is
//! like `Arc` and [`BorrowedFd<'a>`] is like `&'a Arc` (and similar for the Windows types). In
//! particular, given a `BorrowedFd<'a>`, you are not allowed to close the file descriptor -- just
//! like how, given a `&'a Arc`, you are not allowed to decrement the reference count and
//! potentially free the underlying object. There is no equivalent to `Box` for file descriptors in
//! the standard library (that would be a type that guarantees that the reference count is `1`),
//! however, it would be possible for a crate to define a type with those semantics.

    /// 1. This reader has reached its "end of file" and will likely no longer
    ///    be able to produce bytes. Note that this does not mean that the

    ///    but if more data is appended to the file, future calls to `read` will return
    ///    more data.
    /// 2. The buffer specified was 0 bytes in length.
    ///
    /// It is not an error if the returned value `n` is smaller than the buffer size,

    /// This may happen for example because fewer bytes are actually available right now
    /// (e. g. being close to end-of-file) or because read() was interrupted by a signal.
    ///
    /// As this trait is safe to implement, callers in unsafe code cannot rely on

//! The `Box<T>` type for heap allocation.
//!
//! [`Box<T>`], casually referred to as a 'box', provides the simplest form of
//! heap allocation in Rust. Boxes provide ownership for this allocation, and
//! drop their contents when they go out of scope. Boxes also ensure that they
//! never allocate more than `isize::MAX` bytes.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Move a value from the stack to the heap by creating a [`Box`]:
//!
//! ```
//! let val: u8 = 5;
//! let boxed: Box<u8> = Box::new(val);
//! ```
//!
//! Move a value from a [`Box`] back to the stack by [dereferencing]:
//!
//! ```
//! let boxed: Box<u8> = Box::new(5);
//! let val: u8 = *boxed;
//! ```
//!
//! Creating a recursive data structure:
//!
//! ```
//! ##[allow(dead_code)]
//! #[derive(Debug)]
//! enum List<T> {
//!     Cons(T, Box<List<T>>),
//!     Nil,
//! }
//!
//! let list: List<i32> = List::Cons(1, Box::new(List::Cons(2, Box::new(List::Nil))));
//! println!("{list:?}");
//! ```
//!
//! This will print `Cons(1, Cons(2, Nil))`.
//!
//! Recursive structures must be boxed, because if the definition of `Cons`
//! looked like this:
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0072
//! # enum List<T> {
//! Cons(T, List<T>),
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! It wouldn't work. This is because the size of a `List` depends on how many
//! elements are in the list, and so we don't know how much memory to allocate
//! for a `Cons`. By introducing a [`Box<T>`], which has a defined size, we know how
//! big `Cons` needs to be.
//!
//! # Memory layout
//!
//! For non-zero-sized values, a [`Box`] will use the [`Global`] allocator for
//! its allocation. It is valid to convert both ways between a [`Box`] and a
//! raw pointer allocated with the [`Global`] allocator, given that the
//! [`Layout`] used with the allocator is correct for the type. More precisely,
//! a `value: *mut T` that has been allocated with the [`Global`] allocator
//! with `Layout::for_value(&*value)` may be converted into a box using
//! [`Box::<T>::from_raw(value)`]. Conversely, the memory backing a `value: *mut
//! T` obtained from [`Box::<T>::into_raw`] may be deallocated using the
//! [`Global`] allocator with [`Layout::for_value(&*value)`].
//!
//! For zero-sized values, the `Box` pointer still has to be [valid] for reads
//! and writes and sufficiently aligned. In particular, casting any aligned
//! non-zero integer literal to a raw pointer produces a valid pointer, but a
//! pointer pointing into previously allocated memory that since got freed is
//! not valid. The recommended way to build a Box to a ZST if `Box::new` cannot
//! be used is to use [`ptr::NonNull::dangling`].
//!
//! So long as `T: Sized`, a `Box<T>` is guaranteed to be represented
//! as a single pointer and is also ABI-compatible with C pointers
//! (i.e. the C type `T*`). This means that if you have extern "C"
//! Rust functions that will be called from C, you can define those
//! Rust functions using `Box<T>` types, and use `T*` as corresponding
//! type on the C side. As an example, consider this C header which
//! declares functions that create and destroy some kind of `Foo`
//! value:
//!
//! ```c
//! /* C header */
//!
//! /* Returns ownership to the caller */
//! struct Foo* foo_new(void);
//!
//! /* Takes ownership from the caller; no-op when invoked with null */
//! void foo_delete(struct Foo*);
//! ```
//!
//! These two functions might be implemented in Rust as follows. Here, the
//! `struct Foo*` type from C is translated to `Box<Foo>`, which captures
//! the ownership constraints. Note also that the nullable argument to
//! `foo_delete` is represented in Rust as `Option<Box<Foo>>`, since `Box<Foo>`
//! cannot be null.
//!
//! ```
//! #[repr(C)]
//! pub struct Foo;
//!
//! #[no_mangle]
//! pub extern "C-unwind" fn foo_new() -> Box<Foo> {
//!     Box::new(Foo)
//! }
//!
//! #[no_mangle]
//! pub extern "C-unwind" fn foo_delete(_: Option<Box<Foo>>) {}
//! ```
//!
//! Even though `Box<T>` has the same representation and C ABI as a C pointer,
//! this does not mean that you can convert an arbitrary `T*` into a `Box<T>`
//! and expect things to work. `Box<T>` values will always be fully aligned,
//! non-null pointers. Moreover, the destructor for `Box<T>` will attempt to
//! free the value with the global allocator. In general, the best practice
//! is to only use `Box<T>` for pointers that originated from the global
//! allocator.
//!
//! **Important.** At least at present, you should avoid using
//! `Box<T>` types for functions that are defined in C but invoked
//! from Rust. In those cases, you should directly mirror the C types
//! as closely as possible. Using types like `Box<T>` where the C
//! definition is just using `T*` can lead to undefined behavior, as
//! described in [rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines#198][ucg#198].
//!
//! # Considerations for unsafe code
//!
//! **Warning: This section is not normative and is subject to change, possibly
//! being relaxed in the future! It is a simplified summary of the rules
//! currently implemented in the compiler.**
//!
//! The aliasing rules for `Box<T>` are the same as for `&mut T`. `Box<T>`
//! asserts uniqueness over its content. Using raw pointers derived from a box
//! after that box has been mutated through, moved or borrowed as `&mut T`
//! is not allowed. For more guidance on working with box from unsafe code, see
//! [rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines#326][ucg#326].

/* Nota bene
 *
 *  We could have chosen not to add this impl, and instead have written a
 *  function of Pin<Box<T>> to Pin<T>. Such a function would not be sound,
 *  because Box<T> implements Unpin even when T does not, as a result of
 *  this impl.
 *
 *  We chose this API instead of the alternative for a few reasons:
 *      - Logically, it is helpful to understand pinning in regard to the
 *        memory region being pointed to. For this reason none of the
 *        standard library pointer types support projecting through a pin
 *        (Box<T> is the only pointer type in std for which this would be
 *        safe.)
 *      - It is in practice very useful to have Box<T> be unconditionally
 *        Unpin because of trait objects, for which the structural auto
 *        trait functionality does not apply (e.g., Box<dyn Foo> would
 *        otherwise not be Unpin).
 *
 *  Another type with the same semantics as Box but only a conditional
 *  implementation of `Unpin` (where `T: Unpin`) would be valid/safe, and
 *  could have a method to project a Pin<T> from it.

///
/// This raises interesting questions as to how `s[i]` should work.
/// What should `i` be here? Several options include byte indices and

/// let s = "💖💖💖💖💖";
/// let third_character = s.chars().nth(2);
/// assert_eq!(third_character, Some('💖'));
/// ```
///
/// Next, what should `s[i]` return? Because indexing returns a reference
/// to underlying data it could be `&u8`, `&[u8]`, or something else similar.
/// Since we're only providing one index, `&u8` makes the most sense but that
/// might not be what the user expects and can be explicitly achieved with
/// [`as_bytes()`]:
///
/// ```
/// // The first byte is 104 - the byte value of `'h'`
/// let s = "hello";
/// assert_eq!(s.as_bytes()[0], 104);
/// // or
/// assert_eq!(s.as_bytes()[0], b'h');
///
/// // The first byte is 240 which isn't obviously useful
/// let s = "💖💖💖💖💖";
/// assert_eq!(s.as_bytes()[0], 240);
/// ```
///
/// Due to these ambiguities/restrictions, indexing with a `usize` is simply
/// forbidden:
///
/// ```compile_fail,E0277
/// let s = "hello";
///
/// // The following will not compile!
/// println!("The first letter of s is {}", s[0]);
/// ```
///

/// # Deref
///
/// `String` implements <code>[Deref]<Target = [str]></code>, and so inherits all of [`str`]'s
/// methods. In addition, this means that you can pass a `String` to a
/// function which takes a [`&str`] by using an ampersand (`&`):
///
/// ```
/// fn takes_str(s: &str) { }
///
/// let s = String::from("Hello");
///
/// takes_str(&s);
/// ```
///
/// This will create a [`&str`] from the `String` and pass it in. This
/// conversion is very inexpensive, and so generally, functions will accept
/// [`&str`]s as arguments unless they need a `String` for some specific
/// reason.
///
/// In certain cases Rust doesn't have enough information to make this
/// conversion, known as [`Deref`] coercion. In the following example a string
/// slice [`&'a str`][`&str`] implements the trait `TraitExample`, and the function
/// `example_func` takes anything that implements the trait. In this case Rust
/// would need to make two implicit conversions, which Rust doesn't have the
/// means to do. For that reason, the following example will not compile.
///
/// ```compile_fail,E0277
/// trait TraitExample {}
///
/// impl<'a> TraitExample for &'a str {}
///
/// fn example_func<A: TraitExample>(example_arg: A) {}
///
/// let example_string = String::from("example_string");
/// example_func(&example_string);
/// ```
///
/// There are two options that would work instead. The first would be to
/// change the line `example_func(&example_string);` to
/// `example_func(example_string.as_str());`, using the method [`as_str()`]
/// to explicitly extract the string slice containing the string. The second
/// way changes `example_func(&example_string);` to
/// `example_func(&*example_string);`. In this case we are dereferencing a
/// `String` to a [`str`], then referencing the [`str`] back to
/// [`&str`]. The second way is more idiomatic, however both work to do the
/// conversion explicitly rather than relying on the implicit conversion.
///
/// # Representation
///
/// A `String` is made up of three components: a pointer to some bytes, a
/// length, and a capacity. The pointer points to the internal buffer which `String`
/// uses to store its data. The length is the number of bytes currently stored
/// in the buffer, and the capacity is the size of the buffer in bytes. As such,
/// the length will always be less than or equal to the capacity.
///
/// This buffer is always stored on the heap.
///
/// You can look at these with the [`as_ptr`], [`len`], and [`capacity`]
/// methods:
///
/// ```
/// use std::mem;
///
/// let story = String::from("Once upon a time...");
///
// FIXME Update this when vec_into_raw_parts is stabilized
/// // Prevent automatically dropping the String's data
/// let mut story = mem::ManuallyDrop::new(story);
///
/// let ptr = story.as_mut_ptr();
/// let len = story.len();
/// let capacity = story.capacity();
///
/// // story has nineteen bytes
/// assert_eq!(19, len);
///
/// // We can re-build a String out of ptr, len, and capacity. This is all
/// // unsafe because we are responsible for making sure the components are
/// // valid:
/// let s = unsafe { String::from_raw_parts(ptr, len, capacity) } ;
///
/// assert_eq!(String::from("Once upon a time..."), s);
/// ```
///
/// [`as_ptr`]: str::as_ptr
/// [`len`]: String::len
/// [`capacity`]: String::capacity
///
/// If a `String` has enough capacity, adding elements to it will not
/// re-allocate. For example, consider this program:
///
/// ```
/// let mut s = String::new();
///
/// println!("{}", s.capacity());
///
/// for _ in 0..5 {
///     s.push_str("hello");
///     println!("{}", s.capacity());
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This will output the following:
///
/// ```text
/// 0
/// 8
/// 16
/// 16
/// 32
/// 32
/// ```
///
/// At first, we have no memory allocated at all, but as we append to the
/// string, it increases its capacity appropriately. If we instead use the
/// [`with_capacity`] method to allocate the correct capacity initially:
///
/// ```
/// let mut s = String::with_capacity(25);
///
/// println!("{}", s.capacity());
///
/// for _ in 0..5 {
///     s.push_str("hello");
///     println!("{}", s.capacity());
/// }
/// ```
///
/// [`with_capacity`]: String::with_capacity
///
/// We end up with a different output:
///
/// ```text
/// 25
/// 25
/// 25
