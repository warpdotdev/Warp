## Personal fork — danieljohnmorris/warp

This is a personal AGPL fork of [warpdotdev/warp](https://github.com/warpdotdev/warp). It removes the cloud-auth requirement so the OSS build boots straight into a local terminal, hides the notifications inbox, and adds plumbing to route AI agent runs to local CLIs (`claude`, `codex`) instead of Warp's cloud server.

### Configuration (`.env`)

The OSS build reads `~/.warp/.env` (or `./.env` from the cwd) at startup. See `.env.example` for the full list. Common usage:

```env
# Boot directly into a logged-in fake-user state. Skips the browser-check / paywall.
WARP_BYPASS_AUTH=1

# Route agent runs to a local CLI. Currently supported: claude, codex.
# Ollama is wired but not yet implemented.
WARP_LOCAL_AI=claude

# Optional: prepended to the system prompt of every local-AI run.
WARP_ILO_SYSTEM_PROMPT="You are an ilo-lang expert."
```

### What's changed vs upstream

- **Auth bypass**: `WARP_BYPASS_AUTH=1` short-circuits `AuthState::initialize` to a Test user, drops the `cfg(skip_login)` gates so `Credentials::Test` is available in OSS builds, and forces `is_any_ai_enabled` so the AI menu, Cmd+I binding, and agent-mode predicate all light up.
- **Local-AI harness override**: when `WARP_LOCAL_AI` is set, `harness_kind()` overrides the user's selection to the matching `ThirdParty` harness. New `CodexHarness` shells `codex --full-auto`. The agent driver synthesizes the `ResolvedHarnessPrompt` locally so it never calls `ServerApi::resolve_prompt()`.
- **ilo-lang context injection**: `WARP_ILO_SYSTEM_PROMPT` is prepended to every system prompt before the harness writes it to the temp file passed to the CLI subprocess.
- **Notifications inbox hidden**: `HeaderToolbarItemKind::NotificationsMailbox::is_supported()` returns `false`, removing the inbox icon and dropdown from the header toolbar.
- **dotenvy** loads `.env` at the top of `run()` from cwd and `~/.warp/.env`, so launching via `open WarpOss.app` (cwd = `/`) still picks up env vars.

### Known limitations

- The interactive agent panel still dispatches via `generate_multi_agent_output()` → Warp's GraphQL server. Under bypass this returns 401. The `WARP_LOCAL_AI` harness override only intercepts the `agent_sdk` CLI path. Full interactive-UI routing to a local CLI requires synthesizing a `warp_multi_agent_api::ResponseEvent` stream, which is a tracked follow-up.
- `WARP_LOCAL_AI=ollama` logs a warning and is not yet implemented.
- `WARP_ILO_SYSTEM_PROMPT` accepts plain text only; loading from a file path is a follow-up.

### Build

Same as upstream: `./script/run` from this directory builds and bundles `WarpOss.app` to `target/debug/bundle/osx/`. See [Building the Repo Locally](#building-the-repo-locally) below.

## About

[Warp](https://www.warp.dev) is an agentic development environment, born out of the terminal. Use Warp's built-in coding agent, or bring your own CLI agent (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and others).

## Installation

You can [download Warp](https://www.warp.dev/download) and [read our docs](https://docs.warp.dev/) for platform-specific instructions.

## Licensing

Warp's UI framework (the `warpui_core` and `warpui` crates) are licensed under the [MIT license](LICENSE-MIT).

The rest of the code in this repository is licensed under the [AGPL v3](LICENSE-AGPL).

## Open Source & Contributing

Warp's client codebase is open source and lives in this repository. We welcome community contributions and have designed a lightweight workflow to help new contributors get started. For the full contribution flow, read our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.

### Issue to PR

Before filing, [search existing issues](https://github.com/warpdotdev/warp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) for your bug or feature request. If nothing exists, [file an issue](https://github.com/warpdotdev/warp/issues/new/choose) using our templates. Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately as described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-security-issues).

Once filed, a Warp maintainer reviews the issue and may apply a readiness label: [`ready-to-spec`](https://github.com/warpdotdev/warp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aready-to-spec) signals the design is open for contributors to spec out, and [`ready-to-implement`](https://github.com/warpdotdev/warp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aready-to-implement) signals the design is settled and code PRs are welcome. Anyone can pick up a labeled issue — mention **@oss-maintainers** on an issue if you'd like it considered for a readiness label.

### Building the Repo Locally

To build and run Warp from source:

```bash
./script/bootstrap   # platform-specific setup
./script/run         # build and run Warp
./script/presubmit   # fmt, clippy, and tests
```

See [WARP.md](WARP.md) for the full engineering guide, including coding style, testing, and platform-specific notes.
