## About

This is an issues-only repo for [Warp](https://www.warp.dev), a modern terminal with AI and your dev team’s knowledge built-in.

Warp is:
* Built with Rust
* GPU-accelerated
* Compatible with zsh, bash, fish, and PowerShell
* Ready to use on MacOS and Linux ([Windows waitlist](https://www.warp.dev/windows-terminal))

## Installation

You can [download Warp](https://www.warp.dev/download) and [read our docs](https://docs.warp.dev/getting-started/getting-started-with-warp) for platform-specific instructions.

## Changelog and Releases

We try to release an update weekly, typically on Thursdays. Read our [changelog (release notes).](https://docs.warp.dev/getting-started/changelog)

## Issues, Bugs, and Feature Requests

Please [search](https://github.com/warpdotdev/warp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+a+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) through our existing issues for your bug (including workarounds) or feature request.

If you can't find a solution above, please file issue requests [in this repo!](https://github.com/warpdotdev/warp/issues/new/choose)
We kindly ask that you please use our issue templates to make the issues easier to track for our team.

## Open Source & Contributing

We are planning to first open-source our Rust UI framework, and then parts and potentially all of our client codebase. The server portion of Warp will remain closed-source for now.

You can see how we’re thinking about open source here: [https://github.com/warpdotdev/Warp/discussions/400](https://github.com/warpdotdev/Warp/discussions/400)

As a side note, we are open-sourcing our extension points as we go. The community has already been [contributing new themes](https://github.com/warpdotdev/themes). And we’ve just opened our [Workflows repository](https://github.com/warpdotdev/workflows) for the community to contribute common useful commands.
