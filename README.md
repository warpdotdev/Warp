## About

This is an issues-only repo for [Warp](https://www.warp.dev), a [blazingly-fast modern Rust based GPU-accelerated terminal](https://www.warp.dev/blog/how-warp-works) built to make [you and your team more productive.](https://www.warp.dev/blog/how-we-design-warp-our-product-philosophy)

## Supported Platforms

As of Feb 2024, Warp is available to macOS and Linux users, without joining a wait-list.

We are calling this new phase of the product our “public beta” – it’s a “beta” because we know there are still some issues to smooth out, but we are confident that even today the experience is meaningfully better than in other terminals.

We have plans to support [Windows](https://www.warp.dev/windows-terminal) and the Web (WASM)!

## Installation

You can [download Warp](https://app.warp.dev/get_warp) and [read our docs](https://docs.warp.dev/getting-started/getting-started-with-warp) for platform-specific instructions.

## Changelog and Releases

We try to release an update weekly, typically on Thursdays. Read our [changelog (release notes).](https://docs.warp.dev/help/changelog)

## Issues, Bugs, and Feature Requests

Warp has a [community search](https://widget.orbit.love/widget/55808c32-c958-4da7-83de-3512fea1b278) page where you can find solutions to common issues.

If you can't find a solution above, please file issue requests [in this repo!](https://github.com/warpdotdev/warp/issues/new/choose)
We kindly ask that you please use our issue templates to make the issues easier to track for our team.

## Open Source & Contributing

We are planning to first open-source our Rust UI framework, and then parts and potentially all of our client codebase. The server portion of Warp will remain closed-source for now.

You can see how we’re thinking about open source here: [https://github.com/warpdotdev/Warp/discussions/400](https://github.com/warpdotdev/Warp/discussions/400)

As a side note, we are open sourcing our extension points as we go. The community has already been [contributing new themes](https://github.com/warpdotdev/themes). And we’ve just opened our [Workflows repository](https://github.com/warpdotdev/workflows) for the community to contribute common useful commands.
