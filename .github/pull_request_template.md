## Server API dependencies
<!-- You may remove this section if your PR does not have any server dependencies. -->
- [ ] Is this change necessary to make the client compatible with a desired [server API breaking change](https://www.notion.so/warpdev/How-to-safely-introduce-server-API-breaking-changes-0aa805ff5d5d41fd8834f3c95caba0b4?pvs=4#d55ecf8aea3449949d3c33b0e67f6800)?
- [ ] Does this change rely on a [new server API](https://www.notion.so/warpdev/How-to-add-a-new-full-stack-feature-8412cede405a4ec194b32bdd4b951035?pvs=4#04da1e6a493542d68b3e998c7d339640)?
  - [ ] If so, is the use of this API restricted to client channels that rely on the staging server (e.g. WarpDev)?
- [ ] Is this change enabling the use of a server API on client channels that rely on the production server (e.g. WarpStable)?
  - [ ] If so, has the new server API been stable on production for at least one server release cycle? See [here](https://www.notion.so/warpdev/How-to-add-a-new-full-stack-feature-8412cede405a4ec194b32bdd4b951035?pvs=4#73b202f939834b97ab1fbdf7fc82cd53) for more details.

## Changelog Entries for Stable
<!--
The entries below will be used when constructing a soft-copy of the stable release changelog. Leave blank or remove the lines if no entry in the stable changelog is needed. Entries should be on the same line, without the `{{` `}}` brackets. You can use multiple lines, even of the same type. The valid suffixes are:

* NEW-FEATURE: for new, relatively sizable features. Features listed here will likely have docs / social media posts / marketing launches associated with them, so use sparingly.
* IMPROVEMENT: for new functionality of existing features.
* BUG-FIX: for fixes related to known bugs or regressions.
* IMAGE: the image specified by the URL (hosted on GCP) will be added to Dev & Preview releases. For Stable releases, see the pinned doc in the #release Slack channel.
* OZ: Oz-related updates. Use `CHANGELOG-OZ`. At most 4 Oz updates are shown in-app per release.
